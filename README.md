<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, Welcome to my Github</h1>
<h3 align="center">Let's have a look to my latest projects</h3>


- 🔥⚡ Lately I have been working on:
    * **AI Projects** - [Chat with your PDFS](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/ask-multiple-pdfs)
    *   **IoT & Edge Data Analytics** - several public projects with the [Raspberry Pi](https://jalcocert.github.io/RPi/)

 
- 📝 I regularly update the content on *[my Tech Blog](https://about.jalcocertech.xyz/)*
    * I love sharing with others and find Open Source Software captivating, which is why I have created these public guides for [Linux](https://jalcocert.github.io/Linux) and [Docker](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Docker).


- ⚙️Simulations: *I also like to understand how machines work*
    * **[Slider-Crank](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Slider-Crank)** - a DASH app that helps to visualize the physics of a Slider-Crank mechanism
    * **[Bike Simulator](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Bike_dynamic_simulator)** - Bike/Motorbike realtime simulator (Multi-Body System Dynamics made computational and in real time)

- 🚵 Fun fact: I am combining my two wheels passion with [my Trip Planner App](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Py_Trip_Planner) during the stages of my Bike trip across Europe.
