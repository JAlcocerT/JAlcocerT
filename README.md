<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, Welcome to my Github</h1>
<h3 align="center">Let's have a look to my latest projects</h3>


- 🔥 Lately I have been working on these dashboards:
    *   **[R Stocks](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/R_Stocks)** - a [R Shiny App Dashboard](https://r_stocks.fossengineer.com/) that displays interactively [public financial information](https://fossengineer.com/project-shiny-R-Stocks/).
    *   **[Py Trip Planner](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Py_Trip_Planner)** - a [Python Dash App Dashboard](https://trip-planner.fossengineer.com/) that helps you plan interactively your trips considering the [historical weather patterns](https://fossengineer.com/python-trip-planner/) of the chosen location.
 
- 📝 I regularly update the content on *[my Tech Blog](https://fossengineer.com/)*, feeding the posts with the results of the analysis included in my public repositories.
    * I find Open Source Software captivating, and over time, I have contributed by creating comprehensive guides: [Linux](https://jalcocert.github.io/Linux), [Raspberry Pi](https://jalcocert.github.io/RPi/) and [Docker](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Docker).

- ⚙️Simulations and Mechanical Engineering: *I also like to understand how machines work*
    * **[Slider-Crank](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Slider-Crank)** - a DASH app that helps to visualize the physics of a Slider-Crank mechanism
    * **[Bike Simulator](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Bike_dynamic_simulator)** - Bike/Motorbike realtime simulator (Multi-Body System Dynamics made computational and in real time)

- ⚡ Fun fact: I am combining my two wheels passion with the Trip Planner App during the stages of [my Bike trip across Europe](https://fossengineer.com/trip-bike-poland-hungary/).
