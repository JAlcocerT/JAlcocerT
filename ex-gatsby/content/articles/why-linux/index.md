# Cloud

Building on my Linux expertise, I've harnessed the power of cloud technologies to architect and deploy robust, scalable solutions that leverage the agility and efficiency of the cloud, ensuring optimal performance and security for my projects.

In addition to my extensive hands-on experience with GCP (Google Cloud Platform), I hold certifications in Azure, further bolstering my proficiency in cloud computing. This dual expertise allows me to navigate and leverage the strengths of both platforms effectively, providing versatile cloud solutions for a wide range of projects.


## Linux

Over the years, I've cultivated a wealth of Linux foundations, which I've meticulously compiled to facilitate a smoother onboarding experience for newcomers venturing into the cloud realm.

I'm committed to knowledge sharing and have made these resources available on my GitHub repository, ensuring that others can benefit from these insights and accelerate their journey into the cloud: <https://jalcocert.github.io/Linux/>.

## Dev-Ops

In my journey, I've harnessed the power of tools like Ansible, Docker, and Github Acions (as well as Jenkins) to streamline deployment, orchestration, and automation processes. These tools have been instrumental in optimizing workflows, ensuring consistency, and enhancing the overall efficiency of my projects.

I've acquired this diverse skill set through self-guided learning and hands-on experience, a testament to my dedication to continuous growth and mastery in these domains.
