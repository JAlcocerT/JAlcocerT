# Internet of the Things


My expertise in IoT has been a journey fueled by curiosity and a desire to innovate.

I've ventured into the world of IoT, learning and crafting solutions that bridge the physical and digital realms. Through my own exploration, I've gained valuable insights into IoT ecosystems, device connectivity, data processing, and the exciting potential of this transformative technology.


## SBC's

One notable example that showcases the synergy of my data analytics and Linux knowledge is my work with single-board computers in the IoT domain. 

Leveraging my professional experience, I designed and implemented a data analytics pipeline on a single-board computer running Linux.

This solution allowed for real-time data collection, processing, and visualization, opening new avenues for insights and automation within the IoT framework, ultimately delivering enhanced functionality and efficiency.

* I have used Raspberry Pi's and Orange Pi's in this journey. Having shared the learning process openly to everyone on my Github: <https://jalcocert.github.io/RPi/>
