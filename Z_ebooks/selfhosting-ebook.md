Embarking on the self-hosting journey requires a solid understanding of its fundamental components.
This chapter aims to demystify the basics, including domain names, servers, networking, and the role of security and
privacy.
Domain Names: Your Digital Identity
A domain name is your unique identifier on the internet, akin to a physical address in the digital realm. It's what people
type in their browser to visit your website or send you an email.
Choosing the right domain name is crucial; it reflects your identity or brand and should be memorable and relevant.
Acquiring a domain name involves registering it through a domain registrar, a company accredited to sell domain names.
You'll find a plethora of options, with varying prices and features.
Once you've chosen a registrar, you can search for your desired domain name. If it's available, you can proceed to register
it, usually on an annual basis.
Some registrars also offer additional services like privacy protection, which can help mask your personal information from
public domain records.
Servers and Hosting: The Engines of Self-Hosting
At its most basic, a server is a computer that provides data or services to other computers over a network. In the context
of self-hosting, it's the machine where your website, email, or other services will live.
Servers can be physical machines you own, or they can be virtual servers hosted in the cloud.
When choosing a server, consider factors like processing power, memory, storage capacity, and network connectivity.For beginners, a simple setup like a Raspberry Pi or an old laptop/PC might suffice. But as your needs grow, you might look
into more robust options.
Networking: Connecting to the World
Understanding basic networking concepts is crucial in self-hosting. Your server needs to communicate with the outside
world, and that's where networking comes in.
Key components include:
- IP Addresses: These are unique identifiers for devices on a network. Your server will have an IP address, which is how
other devices find and communicate with it.
- There is one Public IP and one Private IP.
- Routers and Switches: These devices manage traffic on your network. Routers, in particular, connect your network to
the internet.
- Ports: Think of these as doors through which different types of traffic enter and exit your server. For example, web traffic
usually comes through port 80 or 443.
