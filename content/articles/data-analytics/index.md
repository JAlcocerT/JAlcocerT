# Data Analytics

My expertise in data analytics spans diverse industries, including Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG), Crypto, and Telecom.

Through meticulous data exploration and analysis, I have harnessed actionable insights that drive informed decision-making and foster innovation in each of these dynamic fields. From optimizing supply chain strategies in FMCG to deciphering blockchain trends in the crypto sphere and extracting meaningful patterns from IoT data, my passion for data-driven solutions has consistently delivered value across a wide spectrum of industries.

## Python

My Python journey began during my university studies and has since become an essential tool in my professional toolkit. From data analysis to web development and machine learning, Python has been my go-to language for solving complex problems and delivering efficient solutions.

Some hands-on examples I've personally crafted, from idea to live deployment, to give you a taste of my full-stack capabilities:

### DASH

I've also worked on exciting projects involving DASH, harnessing its capabilities for creating interactive and data-rich web applications.

* You can see one Open Source DASH App in my Github: <https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Py_Trip_Planner>

### Streamlit

I've leveraged Streamlit to build intuitive and user-friendly data-driven applications that streamline decision-making processes. Plus, it combines perfectly with AI.

## R

In both data science and the dynamic realm of cryptocurrency, I've utilized my expertise in R to unearth valuable insights, conduct data-driven analysis, and shape strategies that navigate the complexities of the crypto landscape.

### Shiny

With Shiny, I've consistently exceeded my clients' expectations by delivering dynamic dashboards that replaced static reports. This interactive approach not only enhances their data visualization experience but also empowers them with real-time insights and actionable information, elevating the value I bring to each engagement.
