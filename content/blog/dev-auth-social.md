**Tl;DR**

I got working a simple md editor for slidev with couple of branches to master firebase and logto SDKs for auth:

+++ Got Firebase and LogtoJS SDKs [both working](#conclusions) and ready to authenticate quick any webapp project.

**Intro**

If you are into [marketing/social media](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/social-media-automation/) and have used its related tools, you know that its a game of volume.

Say that for every 1000 cold emails you do, 2-4% will move towards the next step (and you will be lucky).

You dont want to throw away the mkt efforts, by having a landing and SaaS login that provides too much friction.

And if you have ever worked on **ecommerce**, you should know that a social sign in converts ~95%, instead of the ~80+% of a email/pwd.

> Some people just make you signin by placing your mail and receiving a code: 

With this post, lets try to understand how to make those social signins for good.

With the goal of not working our [SaaS KPIs](#faq)

And...in the mean time play with a wrapper of a SliDEvJS editor.

You can get started with such project and cursor like:


**The Stack** [NextJS + ToastUI](#how-to-create-an-slidev-editor) + [SliDev](#slidev-goodies).

Just as I have been using recently on the [astro-editor for the multilang astro editor](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/astro-i18/). 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/JAlcocerT/slidev-editor
cd slidev-editor && make run-detached #localhost:3000 for the editor

# npm list -g @slidev/cli
# /usr/lib
# └── @slidev/cli@51.4.0

## docker exec -it slidev-sample sh
#docker system prune --all --volumes
```

Remember you had presenter mode with SliDev at `localhost:3030/presenter` and you can even record your presentation

{{% details title="SliDev x VueJS x CSR 🚀" closed="true" %}}

Yes, **Slidev is a web-based presentation tool built on top of Vue.js** and it primarily uses a **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)** approach.

It's designed for developers to create presentations using a combination of Markdown and Vue components.


Slidev and Vue.js

Slidev is an application built with the **Vue.js framework**, specifically Vue 3. It leverages Vue's component-based architecture to make the slides highly customizable and interactive. For example, you can embed your own custom Vue components directly into a slide to create live demos or interactive visualizations.

The entire presentation is a **Single-Page Application (SPA)** that is powered by Vue. When you create your slides in Markdown, Slidev parses the content and renders it into Vue components. This allows for features like:

* **Dynamic content:** You can use Vue's data reactivity to create dynamic elements.
* **Animations:** It integrates with Vue's transition system to handle slide transitions and element animations.
* **Customization:** You can create your own layouts and components using Vue's syntax, giving you complete control over the design and functionality.

CSR Only?

For a typical presentation, **Slidev is a CSR-only framework**. When you build your presentation for production, it generates static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that are meant to be served from a web server. The browser then downloads these files and renders the entire presentation dynamically on the client-side. There's no server-side rendering (SSR) involved in the core functionality of presenting the slides.

This CSR approach is what makes Slidev presentations so portable. 

They can be hosted on any static hosting service like GitHub Pages or Netlify, and they don't require a dedicated backend server to run. 

The entire logic for navigating slides, playing animations, and handling interactive elements resides in the client's browser.

3. Monaco Editor: yea...the one I used [here as simple .md editor](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/audio-recap/#simple-md-editor)



{{< details title="More on Monaco Editor and CSR 📌" closed="true" >}}


Client-Side Rendering (CSR): The entire editor is built on client-side rendering.

The browser downloads the necessary JavaScript and CSS files, and the editor is then constructed and rendered dynamically on the web page.

There is no server-side rendering involved in the editor's core functionality itself.

The **Monaco editor itself does not have a built-in runtime environment** to execute the code.

Its sole purpose is to provide a rich code-editing experience in the browser. 


1. The Editor Itself is Client-Side

The entire Monaco editor interface—the text, syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and even the diagnostics (the red squiggly lines for errors)—is a result of **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)**. The JavaScript and TypeScript code that makes the editor work runs directly in your browser. This includes the "language services" that provide the intelligent features, which are often run in a **Web Worker** to avoid freezing the main browser thread. 

However, this is all **static analysis** of the code, not execution. The editor understands the syntax and structure of the code, but it doesn't run it.

2. Runtime Environment is a Separate Component

To actually execute the code written in the Monaco editor, you need to connect it to a separate runtime environment. This can be done in two ways:

* **In-Browser Execution (for JavaScript/TypeScript):** You can use the browser's native JavaScript engine to run the code. This is how many online code sandboxes or playgrounds work. When you click "Run," the website takes the code from the editor and either puts it into an `<iframe>` or runs it directly in the main browser context, displaying the output in a separate console-like area. This is a form of CSR, but it's separate from the editor's core function. 

* **Server-Side Execution (for other languages):** For languages like Python, C++, Java, or even Node.js, the code must be sent to a backend server. This server would have the necessary runtime and security sandboxing in place to execute the code and return the output. This is the most common approach for online coding challenges or platforms like Replit and Glitch. The server handles all the actual execution, while the browser only handles the input (the editor) and output.

## BaaS

Many popular Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platforms offer Google social sign-in.

This is a common and important feature for user authentication. 

The most prominent players in this space are **Firebase Authentication**, **Supabase**, and **PocketBase**.

Once the **main branch** was ready with some SliDev Editor PoC working powered by NextJS...

It was time to do [some git branching](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/git-recap/)...

```sh
git branch -a

#create a new branch from main
git checkout -b firebaseauth main #git checkout -b <new-branch-name> main

#git checkout main && git pull origin main
#git checkout -b business-feature
```

### 1. Firebase Authentication 🤖

**Firebase Authentication** is a Backend-as-a-Service provided by Google, so it naturally has deep integration with Google Sign-in.

It provides a robust, pre-built authentication system that is easy to integrate into web and mobile apps. It supports various sign-in methods, including Google, Facebook, Twitter, and email/password.

Its tight integration with other Firebase services like Firestore and Cloud Functions makes it a popular choice for developers already in the Google ecosystem.

* **Pros:**
    * **Extremely easy setup** for Google Sign-in.
    * **Generous free tier** for getting started.
    * **Seamless integration** with the entire Firebase suite.
    * **Managed and scalable**, so you don't have to worry about infrastructure.

* **Cons:**
    * **Vendor lock-in** to the Google ecosystem.
    * Can become **expensive at scale** depending on your read/write operations.
    * Uses a **NoSQL database (Firestore)**, which can be a limitation for projects requiring complex relational queries.



{{% details title="Firebase Auth branch with Cursor 🚀" closed="true" %}}


I have just created a new branch to experiment with firebase authentication

can you create a z-firease-auth.md to explain what I need to get from google to get this going?

and also implement a email/password sign in sign up, which also will allow for google social signin?

the landing page should be visible for all, and the demo presentation as well, but the editor itself it has to be auth protected

for now, all users will see the very same editor

```

![NextJS + Firebase Auth working](/blog_img/entrepre/public-build/slidev-editor/firebaseauth-4.png)

As this was the 3rd time I did this, it was 2 min, instead of the initial 45 and the 5 min later on.

BTW: email verification when not doing the social signup also working (goes to spam though) from domain `dmproperties.firebaseapp.com`

https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/stonks/#astro-x-data-x-chartjs
https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/firebase-auth-101/

And for the server x300:

```sh
#docker compose -f docker-compose.server.yml up --build
docker compose -f docker-compose.server.yml up --build -d
#docker network connect cloudflared_tunnel slidev-editor #network -> container name
docker inspect slidev-editor --format '{{json .NetworkSettings.Networks}}' | jq #publish it via Zero Trust with pystonks-app-streamlit:8501
```

With that ready, just do your CF setup: `slidev-editor:3000`

#### Firebase x Particular User Admin Page

You can direct a user to a specific, personalized URL (/admin/useremail) in a Next.js app after they sign in with Firebase Auth. 

You'll use Firebase Auth on the client side to get the user's information and then use Next.js's routing to redirect them. 

To ensure that only they can see that page, you'll need to implement client-side and server-side route protection.

Yes, what you've described is a standard and secure way to build this kind of application using **Firebase Auth** and **Next.js**.

The approach is secure because it relies on both client-side and server-side checks.

1. Client-Side Protection
The client-side logic in your Next.js app ensures that a user is redirected away if their email doesn't match the one in the URL or if they're not signed in. While this provides a good user experience, it's not foolproof on its own. A malicious user could bypass it by disabling JavaScript in their browser. This is why the server-side check is so crucial.


2. Server-Side Protection
The real security comes from the server-side check using Next.js's **`getServerSideProps`** and the **Firebase Admin SDK**.

* **Verification:** When the page is requested, the `getServerSideProps` function on the server verifies the user's ID token. The ID token is a JWT (JSON Web Token) that proves the user's identity. It's signed by Firebase and is tamper-proof.
* **Trust:** Your server trusts Firebase to verify the token's authenticity. It's not just checking an email from the URL, but it's verifying a cryptographically signed token that proves the user's identity and confirms that they are the person they claim to be.
* **Conditional Rendering:** If the token is invalid, expired, or doesn't match the user in the URL, the server simply refuses to render the page and redirects the request to a login page. This prevents unauthorized content from ever reaching the user's browser, making it highly secure. 

In short, the combination of Firebase Authentication on the client side for user sign-in and the **Firebase Admin SDK** on the Next.js server for token verification creates a robust and secure system.

#### Firebase x Particular users SignUp

This must be done **within your code**, not in the Firebase Web UI.

While the Firebase console allows you to enable or disable different sign-in methods (like Email/Password, Google, etc.), it does not have a feature to restrict user sign-ups to a specific list of emails.

This is a deliberate design choice because relying on client-side logic for such a critical security task is not secure. A malicious user could easily modify the client-side code to bypass the check.

You need to implement the whitelist logic on a trusted server-side environment, which is where **Firebase Cloud Functions** come in.

**Why the Code-Based Approach is Secure**

The process for securely implementing an email whitelist in Firebase is as follows:

1.  **Firebase Database (e.g., Firestore):** You'll first store your list of whitelisted emails in a secure collection in Firestore. You would then write security rules to ensure that only an authenticated admin can read or write to this list.

2.  **Next.js App (Client-side):** When a user attempts to sign up with their email and password, your Next.js app **does not** call the `createUser` function from the client-side Firebase SDK. Instead, it makes a request to a **Cloud Function**. 

3.  **Cloud Function (Server-side):** This is the core of the secure setup.
    * The function receives the email and password from your Next.js app.
    * It uses the **Firebase Admin SDK** to query your Firestore database to check if the submitted email exists in your whitelist.
    * **Only if the email is found** on the whitelist does the Cloud Function proceed to use the Admin SDK's `createUser` method to create the new user account in Firebase Authentication.
    * If the email is not on the whitelist, the function returns an error, and no account is created.

This method is secure because the user creation logic is entirely handled on a trusted server (the Cloud Function) where a user has no way of interfering with the process. 


{{< callout type="info" >}}
The user's device only requests the action; it cannot perform it.
{{< /callout >}}

Firebase can be configured to allow sign-up and sign-in only for particular emails, but it isn't a built-in feature you can simply toggle in the Firebase console.

You have to implement this logic yourself using a combination of Firebase services, which makes the process secure.

The Problem

By default, when you enable the Email/Password sign-in method in Firebase Auth, any user can create an account with any email address. 

You can't just provide a list of approved emails and have Firebase automatically block others.

**The Secure Solution 🔒**

To securely restrict sign-ups to a specific list of emails, you'll need to use two key Firebase features: **Cloud Functions** and a **Database** (Firestore or Realtime Database).

Step 1: Create a Whitelist in Your Database

First, create a collection or a node in your Firebase database to store a list of pre-approved emails. Only an admin user should have read/write access to this list through your admin panel.

**Example Firestore Structure:**

```
/approvedEmails
  - "user1@example.com": true
  - "user2@example.com": true
```

Step 2: Use a Cloud Function for User Creation

Instead of allowing users to sign up directly from your Next.js app, you'll create a **Cloud Function**. 

This function will act as a secure intermediary for all sign-up requests.

  * When a user submits their email and password from your app, the app will call this Cloud Function.
  * The Cloud Function will receive the email and password.
  * It will then check the user's email against the **approved email whitelist** in your database.
  * If the email is on the list, the Cloud Function will use the Firebase Admin SDK to **create the user account** directly on the server.
  * If the email is not on the list, the function will return an error, preventing the user from being created.

This approach is highly secure because it moves the user creation logic to a trusted server environment (the Cloud Function). The client app never has the permission to create users directly, so even if a malicious user tampers with the front-end code, they cannot bypass your whitelist.

Step 3: Implement Client-Side Sign-in

Once the user account has been successfully created via the Cloud Function, your Next.js app can proceed with the normal Firebase sign-in process. 

Since the account now exists, Firebase Auth will handle the rest.

Even if a user with an unapproved email manages to sign up, they won't be able to access any of your application's data if you have also correctly configured **Firebase Security Rules** that check for a specific email or a custom claim that you set on approved users.


### 2. Supabase 🚀

**Supabase** is an open-source alternative to Firebase, often referred to as "Firebase for PostgreSQL."

It provides a full suite of BaaS features, including authentication, a real-time database, and serverless functions.

Supabase Auth supports various social providers, including Google.

Because it's open-source and uses a **relational database (PostgreSQL)**, it gives developers more flexibility and control.

* **Pros:**
    * **Open-source**, which offers flexibility and the ability to self-host.
    * Uses **PostgreSQL**, a powerful and widely-used relational database.
    * Has a **built-in authentication system** that integrates seamlessly with its database using Row Level Security (RLS).
    * **Predictable pricing** and a clear path to self-hosting.

* **Cons:**
    * A newer platform compared to Firebase, so its feature set is still maturing.
    * Can have a steeper learning curve for developers not familiar with PostgreSQL.



### 3. PocketBase ⚡

**PocketBase** is a unique, lightweight BaaS platform packaged as a **single-file binary** that includes a Go backend and an embedded SQLite database. It's a great choice for quick prototypes and small-to-medium-sized applications. 

PocketBase supports OAuth2 authentication, which means you can easily implement Google Sign-in.

Because it's **self-hosted**, you have full control over your data and infrastructure.

  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Home-Lab/tree/main/pocketbase" title="Pocketbase Docker Config Setup 🐋 ↗" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

* **Pros:**
    * **Extremely simple and fast to deploy** (just one file).
    * **Built-in features** (auth, database, file storage) work out of the box.
    * **Free to use** (you only pay for your hosting costs).
    * Offers a **real-time API** out of the box.

* **Cons:**
    * **Not a managed service**, so you are responsible for hosting, scaling, and backups.
    * The embedded SQLite database may not be suitable for large-scale, high-concurrency applications.
    * Doesn't have a built-in serverless functions feature like Firebase or Supabase.

## AaaS

When you need robust user management, including social sign-in and email verification, but don't need the entire suite of backend services (like a database, file storage, etc.), you're looking for an **Authentication-as-a-Service (AaaS)** or **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** provider.

These services specialize in handling user authentication and authorization, and they often integrate with your existing backend and application architecture. Here are some of the most popular and powerful options:

### 1. Clerk 💼

**Clerk** is a modern and developer-friendly platform that focuses on providing a seamless, full-stack user management experience.

But I want to compare kneck to kneck with couple of new *auth architectures* ive been learning along the way.



![Logto Admin Panel](/blog_img/entrepre/public-build/slidev-editor/logto1-panel.png)

```sh
git branch -a
#create a new branch from main
git checkout -b logtojseauth main #git checkout -b <new-branch-name> main
#git checkout main && git pull origin main
```

```
and can we implement similar setup to the firebase authentication, but with LogtoJS?

Add a z-logto-setup.md explaining what I need to do from logto web UI and also create the required env.sample
```

```sh
npm install @logto/next
```

![Logto UI Setup](/blog_img/entrepre/public-build/slidev-editor/logto2-sdk.png)

I selected `Traditional Web` and got the credentials for LogTo:

```
# Logto Endpoint - Your Logto instance URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGTO_ENDPOINT=https://your-domain.logto.app
# Logto App ID - Found in your application settings
NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGTO_APP_ID=your-app-id-here
# Logto App Secret - Found in your application settings (keep this secret!)
LOGTO_APP_SECRET=your-app-secret-here
```

Remember about redirect URIs:

```yml
http://localhost:3000/callback
http://localhost:3000/api/logto/sign-in-callback

#for prod
https://yourdomain.com/callback
https://yourdomain.com/api/logto/sign-in-callback
```

![LogTo Creating Authentication for Web App](/blog_img/entrepre/public-build/slidev-editor/logto3-create-app.png)

Then, you will get your vibe coded logto setup to work:

![Logto signin UI inside the nextjs slidev editor working locally](/blog_img/entrepre/public-build/slidev-editor/logto-connected-nextjs.png)

{{< callout type="info" >}}
See that CORS concept how it appears again. It tells an API endpoint (server) which origins (domains, schemes, or ports) are allowed to request resources from it.
{{< /callout >}}


Logto will validate your signin with an email from: `no-reply@logto.email`

And you can also vibe code your way to a `localhost:3000/debug` in case sth goes wrong:

{{< callout type="warning" >}}

{{< /callout >}}

Make sure to understand the difference of Traditional Web [(MPA) vs SPA](#faq), as I had to do at this .md

The final Logto + NextJS setup worked for me via the SPA way!

The `.env.local` required for this is just:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGTO_ENDPOINT=https://authentication.jalcocertech.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGTO_APP_ID=your-actual-app-id-from-logto
```

![alt text](/blog_img/entrepre/public-build/slidev-editor/logto-spa.png)

![alt text](/blog_img/entrepre/public-build/slidev-editor/logto-spa-config.png)

I would recommend to keep the Logto with the email + Code to confirm. See `Sign in experience` and `Connectors` section.

![alt text](/blog_img/entrepre/public-build/slidev-editor/logto-code.png)

YOu could also do email/user + pwd or social signin (for example with google)

![alt text](/blog_img/entrepre/public-build/slidev-editor/logto-social.png)

> You can create a script to pull registered users from Logto

> > Within logto UI, they are at `User management`

---

## Conclusions

1. Firebase Auth with email/pwd + social signin working on desktop and mobile ✅

2. Also Logto with the email + received code to login ✅

Logto, Firebase Authentication, and PocketBase SDK implement authentication differently, with distinct approaches, features, and use cases. 

Logto Authentication

- Logto is an open-source identity infrastructure focused on secure, standards-based authentication using OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect (OIDC).
- It supports web, mobile, desktop, machine-to-machine (M2M) authentication, and third-party application integration as an Identity Provider (IdP).
- Logto provides protocol-compliant flows with social login, user management, multi-tenancy, RBAC, and supports SAML apps for enterprise SSO.
- Integration involves using SDKs or no-code solutions, handling sign-in, sign-out, and user info with API routes and tokens.
- It also offers a Management API for advanced customization and automation.

**Pros:**
- Open-source, protocol-compliant with OAuth 2.1 and OIDC.
- Supports complex enterprise use cases like SAML SSO, RBAC, multi-tenancy.
- Flexible for machine and user authentication.
- Good for SaaS and AI apps needing secure, scalable auth.

**Cons:**
- Requires understanding of OIDC/OAuth protocols.
- More setup complexity than turnkey solutions.
- Newer ecosystem, less documentation and community compared to Firebase.

Firebase Authentication

- Firebase Auth is a widely-used backend service with SDKs and ready-made UI libraries for authenticating users via email/password, phone, and social providers like Google and Facebook.
- Offers FirebaseUI for drop-in auth flows and supports custom backend integration using industry standards OAuth 2.0 and OIDC.
- The Identity Platform upgrade adds enterprise features like multi-factor authentication, blocking functions, audit logging, multi-tenancy and SAML/OpenID Connect providers.
- Handles token issuance, session management, and user state tracking transparently.

**Pros:**
- Mature, battle-tested with extensive documentation and community.
- Easy to set up with ready-to-use UI and SDKs.
- Deep Firebase ecosystem integration (database, storage, etc.).
- Enterprise-grade features available with upgrade.

**Cons:**
- Vendor lock-in to Google Firebase.
- Pricing can rise steeply with scale and advanced features.
- Less flexible in protocol customization, mainly focused on user auth.

PocketBase SDK Authentication

- PocketBase is an open-source backend framework with built-in lightweight authentication supporting password, OTP, OAuth2 providers, and multi-factor authentication.
- Uses stateless JWT tokens sent with requests; no traditional server sessions.
- Authentication state is managed client-side with token storage and refresh.
- Supports superusers with impersonation and token generation for server-to-server use.
- SDKs provide direct API calls for auth flows and user management.

**Pros:**
- Simple, lightweight, and fully open-source backend.
- Multiple convenient auth methods easily configurable.
- Stateless token-based auth, easy for REST API usage.
- Supports multi-factor authentication and user impersonation.

**Cons:**
- Less fully featured and scalable than Logto or Firebase.
- No built-in UI; requires custom frontend auth flow.
- No dedicated token verification endpoint (uses token refresh for validation).
- More suitable for small-medium projects or embedded auth in local backends.

## FAQ

In Logto (and generally in web development), the difference between a traditional web app ~MPA and a single-page application (SPA) lies in how they load and render content:

- Traditional web apps (also called multi-page apps or MPAs) render pages entirely on the server. Each user action like clicking a link or submitting a form causes the browser to request a new page from the server, which returns the full HTML for that page. This approach works well for simple apps with mainly read-only content and benefits from being SEO-friendly and able to function without JavaScript.

- SPAs load a single HTML page initially and dynamically update the content within that page as users interact, without full page reloads. SPAs rely heavily on client-side JavaScript frameworks (like React or Vue) to fetch and render data on the fly, offering a smooth, app-like user experience that is highly interactive and fast. SPAs require JavaScript support and are more complex to develop and optimize, particularly for SEO.

Why it matters in Logto and general application scenarios:

- Traditional web apps suit use cases with simple or read-only client-side interactions, public-facing sites where SEO and discoverability are priorities, or where users might have limited JavaScript support.

- SPAs are better for rich, highly interactive user interfaces, applications requiring complex features like live data updates, and scenarios where responsive and smooth user experiences are critical.

Choosing the right model affects development effort, performance, user experience, SEO, and how the app interacts with authentication and authorization services like Logto.

In sum, Logto differentiates these to guide developers on how best to integrate authentication flows depending on whether their app is traditional server-rendered or SPA, ensuring security and user experience are optimized for the app type.[1][2


### How to create an SliDev-Editor

{{< details title="My Initial requirements for the SliDevJSEditor for Cursor 📌" closed="true" >}}

We want to build a local-first markdown editor for SliDev presentations

The application should be built with a focus on an efficient content edition via markdown, specifically for SliDEVJS.

**Core Requirements** - The following features are mandatory for the initial build of the application, which should be created in the root of the repo.

Folder Selection: The user must be able to select a local folder to scan for files inside `./slidev`.
This should be implemented via a visible input field or a file picker dialog, by default, it can be `./slidev/slidev-sample`

File Tree/List: After selecting a folder, the application must display the related `slides.md`. If a toggle is ON, a full a list of all `.md` and `.mdx` files found within that folder will also be visible to select.

Side-by-Side Editor: When a file is selected from the list, the **ToastUI Editor** should open on the right-hand side of the screen, with the file list remaining visible on the left.

Editor Functionality: The ToastUI Editor must be fully functional, including markdown editing, saving the .md or .mdx to local storage and a live preview of the content.

Focus Mode: A button or toggle that hides the file list, expanding the editor to full width for a distraction-free writing experience.

File Saving: The application must have a clear mechanism to save the current editor content directly back to the selected local `.md` or `.mdx` file.

We can use **NextJS** as backend as it should be easier to integrate with Slidev than fastAPI.

Consider that the main page of the app will be a landing page, where we describe what it does.

Then it will have a path called /app, where all the editor will be visible and in /app/slidev/slidev-example we will see the statically render of the presentation

Make the UI layout look sleek and modern (gradients and all goodies). 

Make it also mobile friendly.

You can also add the docker containers setup with a Dockerfile.dev a docker-compose.dev.yml and a Makefile with just 3 commands: spin the nextjs editor baremetal, another to build the container and another to build and run the container within this dev mode.


**Good-to-Have Features** - I did not mentioned these on the first go

These features are highly recommended to elevate the user experience and create a more complete tool.

Frontmatter Editor: A dedicated UI panel, separate from the main markdown content, for editing a file's frontmatter (e.g., title, date, tags, description). This prevents syntax errors and provides a structured way to manage metadata.

Asset Handling: The ability to drag and drop images directly into the editor. The application should handle placing the image file into a specified local directory (e.e., src/assets/images) and automatically insert the correct markdown link into the document.

File Management: Add basic file management capabilities such as creating new files, creating new folders, and deleting existing files directly from the UI.

I got this after the first iteration:

![alt text](/blog_img/entrepre/public-build/slidev-editor/nextjs-slidev-editorlanding.png)

```sh
git init
git branch -m main
git config user.name
git config --global user.name "JAlcocerT"
git config --global user.name
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Starting slidev-editor via NextJS and ToastUI"

#sudo apt install gh
gh auth login
gh repo create slidev-editor --private --source=. --remote=origin --push

#git init && git add . && git commit -m "Initial commit: Starting astro editor via NextJS and ToastUI" && gh repo create astro-editor --private --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

> On this one, created main for the base functionalities of a **markdown editor for slidev** and created branches to test few authentication methods.
