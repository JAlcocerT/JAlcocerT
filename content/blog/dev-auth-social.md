**Intro**

If you are into marketing and have used its related tools, you know that its a game of volume.

Say that for every 1000 cold emails you do, 2-4% will move towards the next step (and you will be lucky).

You dont want to throw away the mkt efforts, by having a landing and SaaS login that provides too much friction.

And if you have ever worked on ecommerce, you should know that a social sign in converts ~95%, instead of the ~80+% of a email/pwd.

## BaaS

Many popular Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platforms offer Google social sign-in.

This is a common and important feature for user authentication. 

The most prominent players in this space are **Firebase Authentication**, **Supabase**, and **PocketBase**.

***

### 1. Firebase Authentication ü§ñ

**Firebase Authentication** is a Backend-as-a-Service provided by Google, so it naturally has deep integration with Google Sign-in. It provides a robust, pre-built authentication system that is easy to integrate into web and mobile apps. It supports various sign-in methods, including Google, Facebook, Twitter, and email/password. Its tight integration with other Firebase services like Firestore and Cloud Functions makes it a popular choice for developers already in the Google ecosystem.

* **Pros:**
    * **Extremely easy setup** for Google Sign-in.
    * **Generous free tier** for getting started.
    * **Seamless integration** with the entire Firebase suite.
    * **Managed and scalable**, so you don't have to worry about infrastructure.

* **Cons:**
    * **Vendor lock-in** to the Google ecosystem.
    * Can become **expensive at scale** depending on your read/write operations.
    * Uses a **NoSQL database (Firestore)**, which can be a limitation for projects requiring complex relational queries.



***

### 2. Supabase üöÄ

**Supabase** is an open-source alternative to Firebase, often referred to as "Firebase for PostgreSQL." It provides a full suite of BaaS features, including authentication, a real-time database, and serverless functions. Supabase Auth supports various social providers, including Google. Because it's open-source and uses a **relational database (PostgreSQL)**, it gives developers more flexibility and control.

* **Pros:**
    * **Open-source**, which offers flexibility and the ability to self-host.
    * Uses **PostgreSQL**, a powerful and widely-used relational database.
    * Has a **built-in authentication system** that integrates seamlessly with its database using Row Level Security (RLS).
    * **Predictable pricing** and a clear path to self-hosting.

* **Cons:**
    * A newer platform compared to Firebase, so its feature set is still maturing.
    * Can have a steeper learning curve for developers not familiar with PostgreSQL.

### 3. PocketBase ‚ö°

**PocketBase** is a unique, lightweight BaaS platform packaged as a **single-file binary** that includes a Go backend and an embedded SQLite database. It's a great choice for quick prototypes and small-to-medium-sized applications. PocketBase supports OAuth2 authentication, which means you can easily implement Google Sign-in. Because it's self-hosted, you have full control over your data and infrastructure.

* **Pros:**
    * **Extremely simple and fast to deploy** (just one file).
    * **Built-in features** (auth, database, file storage) work out of the box.
    * **Free to use** (you only pay for your hosting costs).
    * Offers a **real-time API** out of the box.

* **Cons:**
    * **Not a managed service**, so you are responsible for hosting, scaling, and backups.
    * The embedded SQLite database may not be suitable for large-scale, high-concurrency applications.
    * Doesn't have a built-in serverless functions feature like Firebase or Supabase.

## AaaS

That's a great question, as it gets to the heart of a broader category of services beyond just pure "BaaS" platforms. When you need robust user management, including social sign-in and email verification, but don't need the entire suite of backend services (like a database, file storage, etc.), you're looking for an **Authentication-as-a-Service (AaaS)** or **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** provider.

These services specialize in handling user authentication and authorization, and they often integrate with your existing backend and application architecture. Here are some of the most popular and powerful options:

### 1. Clerk üíº

**Clerk** is a modern and developer-friendly platform that focuses on providing a seamless, full-stack user management experience. It's particularly popular with front-end developers using frameworks like Next.js, as it provides pre-built, customizable UI components for sign-up, sign-in, user profiles, and more. It offers a generous free tier and is known for its excellent developer experience.

* **Key Features:**
    * **Pre-built UI components:** This is a huge time-saver. You can drop in components for authentication flows, user profiles, and organization management.
    * **Full-stack integration:** It provides SDKs for both front-end and back-end frameworks, ensuring secure and seamless authentication.
    * **Extensive authentication methods:** Supports Google, GitHub, and other social sign-ins, along with email/password, magic links, and more.
    * **Email and SMS verification:** Built-in email verification and password reset flows.

### 2. Okta üè¢

**Okta** is a massive, enterprise-grade identity platform. It's a leader in the IAM space, focusing on both workforce identity (managing employee access) and customer identity (CIAM) for your applications. Okta's solutions are incredibly comprehensive, scalable, and secure. They offer a huge range of features, from simple social login to complex B2B authentication and single sign-on (SSO).

* **Key Features:**
    * **Enterprise-grade security:** Provides robust features like multi-factor authentication (MFA), threat detection, and advanced session management.
    * **Highly customizable:** You can configure authentication flows with "rules" and "hooks" to fit complex business logic.
    * **Wide protocol support:** Supports all major identity protocols, including OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect (OIDC), and SAML.
    * **Extensive integrations:** Integrates with thousands of applications and services out of the box.
    * **Email verification:** Handles email verification and other user management tasks.

### 3. Auth0 (by Okta) üöÄ

**Auth0** was acquired by Okta and is often considered the developer-centric, more flexible arm of the company. It's known for its powerful, yet easy-to-use platform that allows developers to add authentication and authorization to their applications with minimal effort. It's a great middle ground between the full BaaS platforms and the more complex enterprise solutions.

* **Key Features:**
    * **Universal Login:** Provides a customizable hosted login page, so you don't have to build your own UI.
    * **Actions and Rules:** Allows for deep customization of the authentication flow using serverless functions.
    * **Wide range of social connections:** Supports Google and many other social providers, including enterprise connections.
    * **Email verification:** Built-in and configurable email verification and password reset flows.

### 4. Logto ü¶ä

**Logto** is a strong, open-source alternative to the proprietary AaaS platforms. It's a self-hostable identity platform that provides a complete set of features for authentication and user management. Because it's open-source, it's a great choice for developers who want more control over their data and infrastructure without the vendor lock-in of a managed service.

* **Key Features:**
    * **Open-source and self-hostable:** Gives you full ownership and control.
    * **All-in-one:** Includes authentication, authorization, user management, and multi-tenancy.
    * **Framework-free:** Provides SDKs for a wide range of languages and frameworks.
    * **Customizable login experiences:** You can tailor the user-facing parts of the platform to match your brand.
