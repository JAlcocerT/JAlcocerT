I recently found this cool blog: https://kerkour.com/create-problems-to-sell-the-solution

While finding resources for PB.

The author seems to be the creator of: https://github.com/bloom42/markdown-ninja

> Markdown-first CMS for bloggers, minimalists and startups. Open Source alternative to Medium, Mailchimp and Substack - https://markdown.ninja

>> I love the website design btw, also the *trol* part `In Markdown They Trust`

It seems to be another markdown lover :)

## A CMS with Flask

Version 0.2 coming!

## Conclusions


### Lately I...


1. Have tried **Cursor**: https://cursor.com/dashboard

As i consumed all windsurf tokens very fast...

```sh
cd ~/Downloads

chmod +x Cursor-1.4.3-x86_64.AppImage
./Cursor-1.4.3-x86_64.AppImage
```

But that just executes it once.

2. So I got to know: **appimagelauncher**

```sh
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:appimagelauncher-team/stable
sudo apt update

sudo apt install appimagelauncher
mkdir ~/Applications #place your *.AppImages there and they will integrate with your linux!
```

> I also saw this other IDE came out: https://www.dereference.dev/

3. These agentic IDEs consume a lot of resources, so I revisted **[Stacer](https://oguzhaninan.github.io/Stacer-Web/)** to monitor my x13 status:

```sh
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:oguzhaninan/stacer
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install stacer
```
