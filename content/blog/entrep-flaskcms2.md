I recently found this cool blog: https://kerkour.com/create-problems-to-sell-the-solution

While finding resources for PB.

The author seems to be the creator of: https://github.com/bloom42/markdown-ninja

> Markdown-first CMS for bloggers, minimalists and startups. Open Source alternative to Medium, Mailchimp and Substack - https://markdown.ninja

>> I love the website design btw, also the *trol* part `In Markdown They Trust`

It seems to be another markdown lover :)
