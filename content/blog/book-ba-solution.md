## Proposing Solutions: From Concept to Value Realization

This guide focuses on the business analysis activities involved in evaluating solutions, identifying limitations, and recommending actions to maximize value. 

The process **from initial prototypes to fully operational releases**.

### Solution Evaluation: Unlocking Value Creation

Solution evaluation is the ongoing process of assessing a solution's performance and the value it delivers. 

Business analysts play a key role in **identifying and addressing any obstacles** that hinder value realization.  

This evaluation can be applied to:

* **Prototypes/Proofs of Concept (PoCs):** Limited but functional versions demonstrating value.
* **Pilot/Beta Releases:** Limited implementations used to identify issues and assess value before full release.
* **Operational Releases:** Full versions used to achieve business objectives.

### Key Solution Evaluation Tasks

1. **Measure Solution Performance:** Define and implement appropriate methods to assess solution performance, aligning with enterprise goals and objectives.

2. **Analyze Performance Measures:** Examine performance data to understand the value delivered and determine if the solution meets current business needs.

3. **Assess Solution Limitations:** Investigate issues within the solution's scope that may prevent it from meeting business needs.

4. **Assess Enterprise Limitations:** Identify issues *outside* the solution's scope that may be hindering value realization.

5. **Recommend Actions to Increase Solution Value:** Define actions to bridge the gap between potential and actual value.

### Recommendation Samples: From "Do Nothing" to Solution Retirement

Recommendations can range from maintaining the status quo to retiring a solution:

* **Do Nothing:** Recommended when the value of change is low, risks are high, or resources are unavailable.

* **Organizational Change:**  Managing the people side of change. This might involve:
    * Automating/Simplifying Work: Identifying tasks suitable for automation or re-engineering.
    * Improving Information Access:  Enhancing information availability and quality.
    * Reducing Interface Complexity: Streamlining interactions between systems or people.
    * Eliminating Redundancy: Consolidating solutions to address common needs.
    * Avoiding Waste: Removing non-value-adding activities.

* **Identify Additional Capabilities:**  Recognizing and leveraging potential future value beyond initial requirements.

* **Retire the Solution:**  Planning for the replacement or retirement of a solution due to obsolescence, changing needs, or failure to meet objectives.  Consider:
    * Ongoing cost vs. initial investment
    * Opportunity cost of alternative solutions
    * Necessity (e.g., obsolescence)
    * Sunk cost (avoid letting past investment cloud future decisions â€“ focus on future costs and benefits).

### Key Considerations for Recommendations

* **Value Realization:** The primary goal is to maximize the value delivered by the solution.
* **Feasibility:** Recommendations must be realistic and achievable.
* **Stakeholder Buy-in:**  Involve stakeholders in the evaluation and recommendation process.
* **Continuous Improvement:** Solution evaluation is an ongoing process to drive continuous improvement.
