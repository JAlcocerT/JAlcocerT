Its time to have a look to these and put some code together into the Multi Agents project:

1. [RAGs](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/how-to-use-rags-with-python/)
2. [Function calling](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/how-to-use-openai-function-calling/)
3. [Structured OutputS](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/how-to-use-structured-outputs-LLM/),...
4. [Langfuse](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/big-data-tools-for-data-analytics/#dsc-tools-for-da-projects) and [MLFlow](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/comparing-rag-and-use-cases/#mlflow)...
5. LangFlow and LangGraph (which supports cyclic Graphs)
6. MCP - Model Context protocol

{{< details title="LangGraph vs LangChain | Summarized with Groq üìå" closed="true" >}}

LangChain is a framework that focuses on chaining together multiple language models to generate more accurate and informative responses. By leveraging the strengths of individual models, LangChain creates a robust system capable of tackling complex linguistic tasks. The video highlights LangChain's ability to handle long-range dependencies, making it an attractive solution for applications that require detailed explanations or storytelling.


LangGraph, on the other hand, takes a more graph-based approach to language understanding. By representing language as a graph, LangGraph can capture relationships between entities, concepts, and relationships, enabling more nuanced and context-aware interactions. The video showcases LangGraph's strength in handling ambiguous or unclear input, making it an ideal choice for applications that require high accuracy and precision.
Key Differences and Applications


LangChain excels in tasks that require creativity and coherence, such as writing stories or generating dialogues. LangGraph, with its graph-based approach, is better suited for tasks that require precision and accuracy, such as question answering or entity disambiguation.

Takeaways

    LangChain and LangGraph are two distinct frameworks with unique strengths and weaknesses.
    LangChain is ideal for applications that require creativity, coherence, and long-range dependencies.
    LangGraph is better suited for applications that require precision, accuracy, and nuanced language understanding.
    Understanding the differences between these frameworks is crucial for harnessing the power of AI in various industries.

### Agents with AutoGen - AG2AI

We have several agent concepts in **AG2 to help you build your AI agents**.

We introduce the most common ones here:

* Conversable Agent: Agents that are able to send messages, receive messages and generate replies using GenAI models, non-GenAI tools, or human inputs.
* Human in the loop: Add human input to the conversation
* Orchestrating multiple agents: Users can orchestrate multiple agents with built-in conversation patterns such as swarms, group chats, nested chats, sequential chats or customize the orchestration by registering custom reply methods.

* Tools: Programs that can be registered, invoked and executed by agents - Agents gain significant utility through tools as they provide access to external data, APIs, and functionality.


Advanced Concepts: AG2 supports more concepts such as structured outputs, rag, code execution, etc.

* https://pypi.org/project/pyautogen/
* https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2

```sh
pip install ag2
#or with the alias!
```


I got started with PyAutoGen thanks to this `.ipynb`:

https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xee3xdatViM4pespvLVVOrHJ8sB1MgO5?usp=drive_link


```py
from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent, config_list_from_json

llm_config = {
    "config_list": config_list_from_json(env_or_file="OAI_CONFIG_LIST")
}

assistant = AssistantAgent("assistant", llm_config=llm_config)
user_proxy = UserProxyAgent("user_proxy", code_execution_config={"work_dir": "coding", "use_docker": False})
user_proxy.initiate_chat(assistant, message="Plot a chart of NVDA and TESLA stock price change YTD.")
# This initiates an automated chat between the two agents to solve the task
```

Advanced agentic design patterns
AG2 supports more advanced concepts to help you build your AI agent workflows. You can find more information in the documentation.

{{< details title="What mor ecan PyAutoGen do? üìå" closed="true" >}}

Yes, PyAutoGen can be used to get information about websites and databases, although the methods and complexity vary. Here's how:

**1. Websites:**

* **Web Scraping:**
    * AutoGen agents can use Python libraries like `requests` and `Beautiful Soup` (or `Scrapy`) to scrape information from websites.
    * Agents can be instructed to:
        * Download HTML content.
        * Parse the HTML to extract specific data.
        * Follow links to navigate through the website.
    * Example:
        * An agent could be asked to get the current price of a product from an e-commerce website.
        * Another agent could be used to summarize the content of a news article.
* **Web APIs:**
    * If the website provides a public API, agents can use `requests` to interact with the API and retrieve structured data (JSON, XML).
    * This is generally more reliable and efficient than web scraping.
* **Browser Automation:**
    * For websites that rely heavily on JavaScript or require user interaction, agents can use libraries like `Selenium` or `Playwright` to automate browser actions.
    * This allows agents to:
        * Load web pages.
        * Interact with elements (buttons, forms).
        * Extract data from dynamic content.

**2. Databases:**

* **SQL Queries:**
    * AutoGen agents can use Python libraries like `sqlite3`, `psycopg2` (for PostgreSQL), `mysql-connector-python` (for MySQL), or `SQLAlchemy` to connect to databases and execute SQL queries.
    * Agents can be instructed to:
        * Connect to a database.
        * Formulate SQL queries based on user requests.
        * Retrieve and process data from the database.
    * Example:
        * An agent could be asked to retrieve a list of customers from a database.
        * Another agent could be used to calculate aggregate statistics (e.g., average sales).
* **Database APIs:**
    * Some databases provide REST APIs or other interfaces that agents can use to interact with the database.
    * This can be useful for cloud-based databases or when direct SQL access is not available.
* **Langchain integration:**
    * AutoGen can work in conjunction with langchain, and therefore use any of the database integrations that langchain provides. This can simplify the database interactions.

**Key Considerations:**

* **Security:**
    * When interacting with websites or databases, it's crucial to handle credentials and sensitive data securely.
    * Avoid hardcoding API keys or database passwords in your code. Use environment variables or secure configuration files.
* **Rate Limiting:**
    * Websites and APIs often have rate limits to prevent abuse.
    * Implement mechanisms to handle rate limits and avoid overloading servers.
* **Data Parsing:**
    * Parsing HTML or database results can be complex, especially when dealing with unstructured or inconsistent data.
    * Use robust parsing techniques and error handling.
* **Ethical Considerations:**
    * Respect website terms of service and database usage policies.
    * Avoid scraping or accessing data that you are not authorized to access.

**AutoGen's Role:**

* AutoGen provides the framework for orchestrating the agents that perform these tasks.
* It enables agents to collaborate, communicate, and coordinate their efforts to achieve complex goals involving websites and databases.
* AutoGen can be used to create agents that can decide which tool, or function to use, in order to get the required information from the website or database.

In summary, AutoGen can be a powerful tool for building applications that retrieve and process information from websites and databases, but it's important to consider the technical and ethical implications of these activities.

### Agents with Llama-Index

LlamaIndex, as described, is designed to work with various tools, data sources, and workflows. 

* https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/using-langchain-with-pandas-df/#llamaindex-and-pandas-dataframes
* https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/how-to-use-rags-with-python/#llama-index


It helps to augment LLMs with context from different data sources such as APIs, SQL databases, PDFs, etc., without being tied to a specific framework.

* https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/

The ability to integrate multiple agents, tools, and data sources makes it adaptable to various development environments and workflows.

Context augmentation involves providing an LLM with specific data (private or external) to help solve a problem, enhancing the LLM's ability to generate relevant answers by accessing relevant data.

Agents are knowledge assistants powered by LLMs that perform tasks using various tools, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) as one tool in a larger workflow.

Workflows combine multiple agents, tools, and data connectors to create complex, event-driven processes that can automate tasks, reflecting advanced LLM applications.

{{< details title="Python deps management - venv uv poetry üìå" closed="true" >}}

Let's break down the pros and cons of `venv`, `uv`, and `poetry` for managing Python projects:

`venv` (Built-in Virtual Environment)

**Pros:**

* **Built-in:** It comes standard with Python 3, so no extra installation is required. This makes it readily available and easy to start with for basic isolation.
* **Lightweight and Simple:** `venv` focuses solely on creating isolated Python environments. It's straightforward to use for basic dependency isolation.
* **Universally Understood:** As the standard, it's the most widely understood and compatible with other Python tools and workflows. Most deployment environments and CI/CD systems have good support for `venv`-based environments.
* **Good for Simple Projects:** For smaller projects with straightforward dependencies, `venv` can be sufficient.

**Cons:**

* **Basic Functionality:** It only manages the Python environment itself. It doesn't handle dependency management, locking, or packaging in a comprehensive way. You typically use `pip` and `requirements.txt` alongside it.
* **Manual Dependency Management:** You need to manually track and update your dependencies in `requirements.txt`. This can be error-prone and doesn't guarantee reproducible builds across different environments.
* **No Dependency Resolution:** `pip` (when used with `venv` and `requirements.txt`) doesn't have a built-in dependency resolver that ensures compatible versions of your dependencies are installed. This can lead to dependency conflicts.
* **Limited Packaging Support:** `venv` itself doesn't provide tools for building and publishing Python packages.

`uv` (Fast Package Installer and Resolver)

**Pros:**

* **Extremely Fast:** `uv` is written in Rust and is significantly faster than `pip` for installing and resolving dependencies. This can drastically reduce the time spent setting up and managing environments.
* **PEP 621 Support:** It understands and utilizes the standard `pyproject.toml` file for project configuration, making it compatible with other modern Python tooling.
* **Virtual Environment Management:** `uv` can create and manage virtual environments, often placing the `.venv` directory directly in the project root by default, which some users prefer.
* **Faster Dependency Resolution:** Its dependency resolver is also much quicker than `pip`'s, leading to faster and more efficient environment setup.
* **Potentially Replaces `pip` and `venv`:** `uv` aims to be a faster alternative to both `pip` and `venv` for many common tasks.

**Cons:**

* **Relatively New:** While promising, `uv` is a newer tool compared to `venv` and `poetry`. Its ecosystem and integration with all existing tools might still be evolving.
* **Limited Feature Set Compared to Poetry:** While it excels at environment management and package installation, it doesn't yet have the full suite of features that `poetry` offers for packaging, publishing, and dependency management. For example, it currently doesn't have its own build backend.
* **Learning Curve (for some):** While designed to be easy to use, switching to a new tool always involves a slight learning curve.
* **Not a Complete Replacement for All Workflows Yet:** Depending on your specific needs, especially around complex packaging and publishing workflows, you might still need other tools in conjunction with `uv`.

`poetry` (Comprehensive Dependency Management and Packaging Tool)

**Pros:**

* **Comprehensive Solution:** `poetry` provides a complete solution for dependency management, packaging, and publishing. It manages your virtual environment, dependencies, build process, and package publishing.
* **Dependency Resolution:** It has a sophisticated dependency resolver that automatically finds compatible versions of your dependencies, preventing conflicts and ensuring reproducible builds with the `poetry.lock` file.
* **`pyproject.toml` Standard:** It uses the `pyproject.toml` file (PEP 621) to store project metadata and dependencies, which is becoming the standard in the Python ecosystem.
* **Reproducible Builds:** The `poetry.lock` file ensures that everyone working on the project uses the exact same versions of dependencies.
* **Packaging and Publishing:** `poetry` simplifies the process of building and publishing your Python packages to PyPI.
* **Dependency Groups:** It allows you to define different groups of dependencies (e.g., development dependencies), keeping your main project dependencies clean.
* **Script Management:** You can define scripts within `pyproject.toml` to automate common development tasks.

**Cons:**

* **Overkill for Simple Projects:** For very small and simple projects with few dependencies, `poetry`'s comprehensive nature might feel like overkill.
* **Can be Slower Than `uv` for Basic Tasks:** While its dependency resolver is powerful, the initial environment setup and dependency installation can sometimes be slower than `uv`.
* **Abstraction Layer:** Some users prefer the more direct control offered by `venv` and `pip`. `poetry` introduces its own layer of abstraction, which might feel less transparent to some.
* **Lock File Conflicts:** While the lock file ensures reproducibility, merge conflicts in the `poetry.lock` file can sometimes be challenging to resolve.

**Here's a table summarizing the key differences:**

| Feature             | `venv`                       | `uv`                             | `poetry`                                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Environment Mgmt.** | Basic creation/activation    | Fast creation/activation         | Integrated                                |
| **Package Mgmt.** | Relies on `pip`              | Fast installation/resolution     | Integrated, with dependency resolution    |
| **Dependency Resolution** | None (via standard `pip`)   | Fast and efficient             | Robust and automatic                      |
| **Locking** | Requires manual `pip freeze > requirements.txt` | Uses `pyproject.toml` for constraints | `poetry.lock` for reproducible builds |
| **Packaging** | Requires separate tools      | Limited                            | Built-in                                  |
| **Speed** | Standard `pip` speed         | Very fast                        | Can be slower for initial setup           |
| **Complexity** | Simplest                     | Moderate                         | More comprehensive                        |
| **Standard Compliance** | Basic                        | Good (`pyproject.toml`)          | Excellent (`pyproject.toml`, PEP 517)   |
| **Maturity** | Long-established standard    | Relatively new                   | Mature and widely adopted                  |

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Both uv and poetry use `pyproject.toml` to define your project's core metadata (name, version, authors) and your direct dependencies.
{{< /callout >}}

They both understand the [project] and [project.dependencies] sections to know which top-level packages your project requires.

**Which one should you choose?**

* **`venv`:** Best for very simple projects or when you need maximum flexibility and direct control and are comfortable managing dependencies manually with `pip` and `requirements.txt`.
* **`uv`:** A great option if speed is a primary concern and you want a faster alternative to `pip` and `venv` for environment management and dependency installation. It's particularly appealing for its performance and adherence to modern standards.
* **`poetry`:** Ideal for larger projects, libraries, and applications where reproducible builds, robust dependency management, and streamlined packaging are crucial. It offers a more opinionated but comprehensive workflow.

Ultimately, the best choice depends on the specific needs and complexity of your Python projects and your personal preferences. 

You might even find yourself using a combination of these tools in different situations. For instance, you might use `uv` for its speed in setting up environments for projects managed by `poetry`.
