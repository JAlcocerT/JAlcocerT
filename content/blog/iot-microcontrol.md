**TL;DR**



## Intro

Last year I bough a couple of **companions for my Raspberry Pi 4 2GB**:

1. [ESP32](#the-esp32)
2. [Pi Pico W](#the-raspberry-pi-pico-w)

And Recently, this new release got my attention:

![Pi and ESP32](/blog_img/iot/pis-esp32.jpg)

3. Raspberry Pi Pico 2 -  A brand new model, with both **ARM and RISC-V cores**

Let me show you **how to get started with MicroControllers**

Just A note on breadboards first:

{{< youtube "mE33WpRWrXs" >}}


## Micro-Controllers

What you need to know **about microcontrollers**:

* They dont need an OS
* They run in loop whatever logic is loaded
* The are low consumption devices (much more than even SBC's)

They are great companions for SBC's like a RPi:

![SBC Raspberry Pi 4](/blog_img/iot/Rpi4_4gb_size.jpg)


<!-- I know this is supposed to be a RPi centered repo and web, but couldn't resist to add some small project that uses the ESP32. -->

### The ESP32

An alternative micro-controller to the [PicoW](#pico-w-and-micropython)!

* Connecting ESP32 to Linux - https://github.com/tio/tio
* IDE - Thonny / Arduino IDE / VSCode ...

> You can do ton of stuff with a ESP32, like building a [drone](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/useful-dron-stuff/):

* https://github.com/Circuit-Digest/ESP-Drone

<!-- 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_mZsiZcy7s -->

{{< youtube "V_mZsiZcy7s" >}}


I prefered to go With Arduino IDE and create test projects like this one.

> Dont forget to include the libraries: `Tools -> Manage Libraries -> DHT sensor library` for ESPx

If you are going to do it via VSCode and [PlatformIO](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide)...

```sh
#ext install platformio.platformio-ide
code --install-extension platformio.platformio-ide
```

> Platformio, is an embedded development ecosystem and a popular VS Code extension. Focus: building, debugging, and uploading firmware for C/C++ frameworks (Arduino, ESP-IDF, etc.).

I recommend you also the **Serial Monitor extension**, [this one](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-serial-monitor), as seen:

```sh
#ext install ms-vscode.vscode-serial-monitor
code --install-extension ms-vscode.vscode-serial-monitor
```

#### Testing ESP32


I have to say thanks to Tomasz and his great content that helped me get started with this: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc3Qnf79Ny8&t=0s>

* <https://github.com/ttarnowski/get-started-with-esp32/blob/main/src/main.cpp>



To 'upload' the code to the ESP32, please make sure that you **have the proper DATA cable** (*I was expending too many hours because of this*).

#### Pico W and MicroPython


Thanks to [core-electronics](https://core-electronics.com.au/guides/raspberry-pi-pico-w-connect-to-the-internet/)

1. Hold the BOOTSEL button on the Pico W
2. Connect the Pico W to your computer via the USB cable
3. Release the BOOTSEL button -> you will see a new device in the PC.

[Download a MicroPython Release](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases) and move it to the Pico folder:

* Mip: <https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib>
    * installing from fork: 

```py    
import mip
mip.install(PACKAGE_NAME, index="https://USERNAME.github.io/micropython-lib/mip/BRANCH_NAME")
```

<https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico-w/rp2-pico-w-latest.uf2>

unplug usb and plug

To install libraries, i have observed that recently **upip has been depricated in favour of mip**

## MQTT With MicroControllers



{{% details title="Setup Eclipse Mosquitto and NodeRed ðŸš€" closed="true" %}}

Open a web browser and navigate to `http://raspberry_pi_ip:1880` (replace raspberry_pi_ip with your Raspberry Pi's IP address).

You should see the Node-RED user interface.

```yml
version: '3'
services:
  mosquitto:
    image: eclipse-mosquitto
    container_name: mosquitto
    ports:
      - "1883:1883"
      - "9001:9001"
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - /path/to/mosquitto/config:/mosquitto/config

  nodered:
    image: nodered/node-red
    container_name: nodered
    ports:
      - "1880:1880"
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - /path/to/nodered/data:/data
    environment:
      - TZ=your_time_zone

```
{{% /details %}}


### MQTT with the RPi and ESP32

Let's setup MosquiTTO and make sure that we understand **how Pub/Sub works** with a dummy example:

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebsXSCKsHeQ&t=302s>
<https://helloworld.co.in/article/mqtt-raspberry-pi-esp32>

```sh
sudo apt install -y mosquitto
sudo apt install -y mosquitto-clients

#sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install paho-mqtt

sudo systemctl status mosquitto.service
```

Publish sample data (from the RPi to the Rpi): https://github.com/jiteshsaini/mqtt-demo/blob/main/rpi_mqtt_clients/client_pub.py

```py
import time
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt


def on_publish(client, userdata, mid):
    print("message published")


client = mqtt.Client("rpi_client2") #this name should be unique
client.on_publish = on_publish
client.connect('127.0.0.1',1883)
# start a new thread
client.loop_start()

k=0
while True:
    k=k+1
    if(k>20):
        k=1 
        
    try:
        msg =str(k)
        pubMsg = client.publish(
            topic='rpi/broadcast',
            payload=msg.encode('utf-8'),
            qos=0,
        )
        pubMsg.wait_for_publish()
        print(pubMsg.is_published())
    
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
        
    time.sleep(2)
```

This will **receive the sample data** when both scripts are running - (in the RPi): <https://github.com/jiteshsaini/mqtt-demo/blob/main/rpi_mqtt_clients/client_sub.py>

```py
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt
import time

def on_connect(client, userdata, flags, rc):
   global flag_connected
   flag_connected = 1
   client_subscriptions(client)
   print("Connected to MQTT server")

def on_disconnect(client, userdata, rc):
   global flag_connected
   flag_connected = 0
   print("Disconnected from MQTT server")
   
# a callback functions 
def callback_esp32_sensor1(client, userdata, msg):
    print('ESP sensor1 data: ', msg.payload.decode('utf-8'))


def callback_esp32_sensor2(client, userdata, msg):
    print('ESP sensor2 data: ', str(msg.payload.decode('utf-8')))

def callback_rpi_broadcast(client, userdata, msg):
    print('RPi Broadcast message:  ', str(msg.payload.decode('utf-8')))

def client_subscriptions(client):
    client.subscribe("esp32/#")
    client.subscribe("rpi/broadcast")

client = mqtt.Client("rpi_client1") #this should be a unique name
flag_connected = 0

client.on_connect = on_connect
client.on_disconnect = on_disconnect
client.message_callback_add('esp32/sensor1', callback_esp32_sensor1)
client.message_callback_add('esp32/sensor2', callback_esp32_sensor2)
client.message_callback_add('rpi/broadcast', callback_rpi_broadcast)
client.connect('127.0.0.1',1883)
# start a new thread
client.loop_start()
client_subscriptions(client)
print("......client setup complete............")


while True:
    time.sleep(4)
    if (flag_connected != 1):
        print("trying to connect MQTT server..")
```

Now, to publish data from the ESP32: <https://github.com/jiteshsaini/mqtt-demo/blob/main/esp32_clients/esp_mqtt_client1/esp_mqtt_client1.ino>

You will need <https://registry.platformio.org/libraries/knolleary/PubSubClient/installation> in the `platformio.ini` as

## FAQ

### MicroController Power Consumption

With a regular powerbank, you can get 5V and up to 1A.

{{% details title="Power Consumption Calculations ðŸš€" closed="true" %}}

To estimate how long a 10,000mAh power bank (5V, 1A output) will last when powering an ESP32, let's calculate step by step:

1. **Key Parameters**
- **Power Bank Capacity**: 10,000mAh at 5V.
- **ESP32 Power Consumption**: Depends on its mode of operation:
  - Active Wi-Fi Transmission: ~160-200mA at 3.3V.
  - Idle Mode: ~20-30mA at 3.3V.
  - Deep Sleep: ~10ÂµA (0.01mA) at 3.3V.
  
  We'll assume **average consumption** during active use is ~150mA at 3.3V.

- **Power Conversion**: The ESP32 operates at 3.3V, so a voltage regulator will step down from 5V, introducing some inefficiency (~85-90% efficient). We'll use 85% for calculation.

2. **Adjust for Voltage and Efficiency**
Convert the power bank's capacity from 5V to 3.3V to match the ESP32:
\[
\text{Effective Capacity at 3.3V} = 10,000 \, \text{mAh} \times \frac{5}{3.3} \times 0.85 = 12,879 \, \text{mAh at 3.3V}
\]


3. **Estimate Runtime**
Using the ESP32's average current draw (150mA at 3.3V):
\[
\text{Runtime (hours)} = \frac{\text{Effective Capacity}}{\text{ESP32 Current Draw}} = \frac{12,879}{150} \approx 85.9 \, \text{hours}
\]


4. **Realistic Adjustments**
- If the ESP32 is in deep sleep most of the time (e.g., IoT sensor application):
  - Assume ~1mA average current draw.
  - Runtime:
    \[
    \frac{12,879}{1} \approx 12,879 \, \text{hours} \, (\approx 536 \, \text{days}).
    \]

- If running in high-power mode constantly (e.g., Wi-Fi transmission):
  - Assume ~200mA average current draw.
  - Runtime:
    \[
    \frac{12,879}{200} \approx 64.4 \, \text{hours}.
    \]

**Summary**
- **Active Wi-Fi Use**: ~64-86 hours (2.5-3.5 days).
- **Deep Sleep Mode**: Several months to a year, depending on wake-up intervals.

The actual runtime **depends ofc**, on your ESP32's workload and power mode.


{{% details title="Understanding mAh versus Wh ðŸš€" closed="true" %}}

No, a 10,000mAh power bank is not exactly the same as 37Wh unless we know the nominal voltage of the battery inside the power bank.

**Understanding mAh and Wh**
1. **mAh (milliamp-hours)** measures the charge capacity of a battery at a specific voltage.
2. **Wh (watt-hours)** measures the total energy capacity, which depends on both the charge capacity and the voltage.

The relationship is:
\[
\text{Wh} = \text{mAh} \times \text{Voltage} \div 1000
\]

**Power Bank Voltage**
- The internal batteries of power banks typically use **3.7V lithium-ion cells**.
- Manufacturers often label the mAh capacity based on the **3.7V nominal voltage** of the battery cells.

For a 10,000mAh power bank:
\[
\text{Wh} = 10,000 \, \text{mAh} \times 3.7 \, \text{V} \div 1000 = 37 \, \text{Wh}
\]

This is likely where the "37Wh" value comes from.

**Output Voltage (5V)**
When the power bank steps up the voltage to **5V** for USB output, the effective energy capacity changes due to voltage conversion losses (efficiency):
- Assume 85-90% efficiency for the boost converter.
- Effective Wh at 5V:
  \[
  \text{Wh at 5V} = 37 \, \text{Wh} \times 0.85 = 31.45 \, \text{Wh (approx.)}
  \]

**Conclusion**
- **At 3.7V (internal battery)**: 10,000mAh â‰ˆ 37Wh.
- **At 5V (output)**: The usable energy will be slightly less due to conversion losses, approximately **31.45Wh** if efficiency is ~85%.

### Solar Power & MicroControllers

I wanted to try with an low cost (~20$) Solar Panel `CL-0915` which goes up to 15W (5V3A).

![Solar Panel](/blog_img/outro/solar-panel.jpg)

Thats really on the edge to power a Pi4.

And ofc the 5V3A are in ideal conditions, so dont bother a Pi wont boot up with it.

But...microcontrollers do.


Even two of them at the same time.
