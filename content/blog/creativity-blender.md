## Using Blender

### Installing Blender

I was consolidating [here](https://jalcocert.github.io/Linux/docs/debian/foss_engineering/#blender) some OSS Tools for engineering.

Among them, Blender:

```sh
#https://www.blender.org/download/release/Blender4.3/blender-4.3.1-linux-x64.tar.xz/

sudo snap install blender --classic #right now it is 4.3.1
#sudo snap install blender --channel=4.3/stable --classic
```

You can always download the versions from: <https://www.blender.org/download/>

### Blender as a Code

### Blender with AI

Image generations models are really interesting.

[On this post](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/stable-difussion-free-generation/) I have reviewed recently the latest tools to use them.
