This year I saw a very cool video about **design patterns**.

{{< youtube "8UAsN9wvePE" >}}


And there is something about designs that have always captivate me.

Whats does make something so good, that it lasts the beats of time?

How can we create someting that is valued by people, even from different generations?

I belive you would agree that the 911 design is one of those.

But...I want to create stuff.

## Using Blender

### Installing Blender

I was consolidating [here](https://jalcocert.github.io/Linux/docs/debian/foss_engineering/#blender) some OSS Tools for engineering and how ti install them with Ubuntu.

Among them, Blender, we just need:

```sh
#https://www.blender.org/download/release/Blender4.3/blender-4.3.1-linux-x64.tar.xz/

sudo snap install blender --classic #right now it is 4.3.1
#sudo snap install blender --channel=4.3/stable --classic
```

You can always download your desired blender versions from: <https://www.blender.org/download/>

### Blender as a Code


I know i might sound lazy.

BUT

Drag and drop on an interface...is something that id like to have automated for me.

And I heard about **Blender with Python Scripting**.

### Blender with AI

Image generations models are really interesting.

[On this post](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/stable-difussion-free-generation/) I have reviewed recently the latest tools to use them.

With controlnet and flux

#### ControlNet vs

With Control net, we can provide more than a text prompt to get the desired results from the T2I models.

I mean, we can provide images as prompts!

## Conclusions


### Using Blender with AI for Home Design

Can Blender be some kind of **homestyler, but F/OSS**?
