## Using Blender

### Installing Blender

I was consolidating [here](https://jalcocert.github.io/Linux/docs/debian/foss_engineering/#blender) some OSS Tools for engineering.

Among them, Blender:

```sh
#https://www.blender.org/download/release/Blender4.3/blender-4.3.1-linux-x64.tar.xz/

sudo snap install blender --classic #right now it is 4.3.1
#sudo snap install blender --channel=4.3/stable --classic
```

You can always download the versions from: <https://www.blender.org/download/>

### Blender as a Code

Blender with Python Scripting.

Thanks to <https://github.com/CGArtPython/blender_plus_python/tree/main>

### Blender with AI

Image generations models are really interesting.

[On this post](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/stable-difussion-free-generation/) I have reviewed recently the latest tools to use them.

With controlnet and flux

#### ControlNet vs

With Control net, we can provide more than a text prompt to get the desired results from the T2I models.

I mean, we can provide images as prompts!

<!-- ## Animations


Python is a versatile programming language that can be used for a wide range of tasks, including creating animations. In this blog post, we will explore the different libraries available for creating animations with Python and learn how to use them to create impressive animations.



Description: Python is not just a programming language for data science or web development, but it can also be used to create stunning animations. In this blog post, we will take a deep dive into the different libraries available for creating animations with Python, such as Matplotlib, Pygame, OpenCV, and Arcade. We will explore the different features of each library and learn how to use them to create different types of animations.
