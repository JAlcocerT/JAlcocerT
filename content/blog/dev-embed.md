**Tl;DR**



**Intro**

Chatwoot has some basic CRM features (contact management, conversation history) but is mainly a helpdesk and messaging platform, not a dedicated CRM.


### Chatbots

#### Flowise

#### n8n

If you've heard about make or zapier, you ve heard about **n8n**

Specially after fireship video...

### Live Chats

Crisp Chat is a customer messaging platform that provides live chat, automated chatbots, multi-channel messaging, and helpdesk tools for websites and businesses.

**Open Source Alternatives**: An OS equivalent to Crisp Chat would include platforms that allow you to host similar live chat and support features yourself. 


- **Chatwoot**: A widely known open-source customer support platform offering live chat, multi-channel inbox (including email, WhatsApp, and others), automation, analytics, and team collaboration tools.
- **Papercups**: An open-source live chat system that can be embedded in websites; it supports automated replies, integrations, and a customizable widget.
- **LiveHelperChat**: Another option, providing live chat and visitor tracking functionality with self-hosting control.


| Platform       | Main Features                      | Hosting        | Integrations              |
|----------------|------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| Crisp Chat     | Live chat, chatbots, automation    | Cloud (SaaS)   | Extensive; proprietary   |
| Chatwoot       | Live chat, multi-channel inbox     | Self-hosted, Cloud | Slack, Email, WhatsApp   |
| Papercups      | Live chat, automation              | Self-hosted    | Slack, Zapier, Email     |
| LiveHelperChat | Live chat, visitor tracking        | Self-hosted    | Limited                  | 

All open-source options let you self-host and customize the software according to your needs, offering most of the core features provided by Crisp Chat, though integrations and advanced automation tools may vary.

If privacy, customizability, or avoiding subscription costs are priorities, Chatwoot and Papercups are two of the strongest open-source choices currently available.

#### ChatWoot

Chatwoot is primarily a **customer engagement** and communication platform, not a full-featured CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system. 

It centralizes conversations from channels like web chat, email, and social media, helps manage tickets, stores customer contact details, provides analytics, and supports automation features like chatbots.

However, while Chatwoot includes some CRM-like capabilities—such as managing and viewing customer profiles, conversation history, and team collaboration—it does not offer the depth of sales pipeline management, deal tracking, or marketing automation found in specialized CRM software like Salesforce or HubSpot. 

> Chatwoot can integrate with actual CRM systems to synchronize customer data for a more complete workflow.

> > Like to Odoo or [GHL some marketers use](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/software-for-marketing-agencies/#ghl)
