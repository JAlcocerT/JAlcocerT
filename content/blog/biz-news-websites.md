I came across SSG looking for simplicity.

Got in love due to the [many ways and how easy is to host them](https://fossengineer.com/alternatives-for-hosting-static-websites/).

2. https://github.com/Mrahmani71/astro-news which can be applied to [this kind of sites](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/BeyondAJourney)

> **MIT** | A news website built with Astro

{{< details title="What I like about Astro News Theme ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

1. Post are writen with `.mdx`

2. **Search** working in prod, not in dev when running `npm run dev`

It uses pagefind, similarly to [the astroverse/visvrs theme](https://github.com/IoTechCrafts/astroverse/blob/main/package.json#L23)

```sh
npm install astro-pagefind pagefind
```

3. **Image optimizations** to `.webp`

4. **OpenGraph** images working when sharing the web (and also considering the post images)
* Icons: https://lucide.dev/

> MIT | Beautiful & consistent icon toolkit made by the community. Open-source project and a fork of Feather Icons.

5. **RSS** Feed and sitemap!
* Very **modular** implementation of which posts goes where thanks to `isBigHeadline` and `isSmallHeadline` 
* Base path is present at `index.ts`

**What could be better**?

1. The header could follow the users when its scrolling
2. It could bring multilanguage support out of the box...

This one is **fantastic** for blogging/news!

Like going from [this one](https://cyclingthere.pages.dev/), towards a more serious [like this one](https://beyondajourney.pages.dev/)

Definitely worth to have a look at it, maybe even enhance it with a photo gallery or a subscription / book selling page.


3. https://github.com/danielcgilibert/blog-template


{{< details title="What I like about Astro Blog-Template / OpenBlog Theme ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

* Post are writen with `.mdx`
* **Search** working in prod
* Cool post index that follows you when in a PC (not at a phone)

**What could be better**?

### Open Source Search for your websites

If you already have your website (Wordpress, Ghost, or SSG's...)

You will want to have search in it.

Mind that not all static search work same, some just work when the ssg is built
