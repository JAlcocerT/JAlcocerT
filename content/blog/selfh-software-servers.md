Few months ago, I wrote about [different **PaaS** Tools](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/deploying-software-with-paas-to-servers/)

Among which, [Dokploy](#dokploy) resonated a lot with me.

I want to make a recap of PaaS Tools available.

### LocalStack

LocalStack is a tool designed for developers who want to test **AWS functionalities locally**. 

It provides an **emulated environment of AWS services**, solving issues related to unpredictable billing and resource management during development. 

- **Purpose**: LocalStack emulates AWS API functionality.
- **Problem Solved**: Allows local testing without involving AWS services directly.
- **Installation**: 
  - Sign up with a GitHub account.
  - Use `brew install localstack/tap/localstack-cli` for installation on macOS.
  - Requires Docker to function as a local ‚Äúmini-cloud‚Äù operating system.
- **Basic Use**: 
  - Set environment variables for AWS access.
  - Create services like S3 buckets using standard AWS commands.
  - Offers a Community Image for free usage.
- **Limitations**:
  - Not all AWS services are fully emulated; some are available only in the Pro version.
  - Works with a single API endpoint unlike AWS's regional separation.
- **Key Features**: 
  - Supports essential services like EC2.
  - Allows basic CRUD operations.
  - Requires understanding of feature coverage before use.

### Dokploy
