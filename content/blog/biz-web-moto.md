## Moto Blogger Setup

My friend wanted to have the following **Astro theme**:

The **theme** - https://github.com/Boston343/horizon
<!-- 
https://github.com/JAlcocerT/horizon
https://github.com/JAlcocerT/ProyectoYosu
https://github.com/Boston343/horizon -->

> Original (and fantastic) job was done by https://github.com/Boston343/horizon and released under GPL3.0

There was a Windows setup in between, so...

...the setup took just a little bit more clicks than in linux:

1. Install node and npm (nodejs.org and docs.npmjs.org)
2. Install git and vscode

3. Install **firebase CLI** - in windows that means pasting the `.exe` to the repo folder and adding it as gitignore to avoid pushing it to the repo
4. Install npm firebase package

Using **Firebase Free Tier Hosting**

```sh
#npm install -g firebase-tools

firebase login
firebase init
#firebase projects:list
```

And to have the my domain linked...

Went to [firebase UI](https://console.firebase.google.com/) -> Compilation -> hosting.

Add a custom domain.

Select my subdomain, and added a **CName + TXT record to the DNS**.

For that domain, Im using cloudflare - so made sure that its **DNS only and not proxied records**

5. Do the one time Firebase Project setup: `.\firebase init`

**Why firebase and not cloudflare?**

Just using Google account was enough after accepting firebase T&C's.

And...thats all the one time things required.

**In a nutshell,** from now on, just these **3 commands** are enough:

```sh
npm run dev #to see locally the changes
npm run build #to render the site to /dist
firebase deploy #to push dist to proyectorutasmoto.web.app
```

> There you go: https://proyectorutasmoto.web.app/


**Next steps** - To link a **custom domain** and to not forget to sync it to github for a free code backup!
