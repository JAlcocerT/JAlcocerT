**TL;DR**


**Intro**

During mar25 we saw how to get running few [sync tools](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/sync-file-tools/).

Later on June, I expanded Traefik https knowledge, and separaredly [Nextcloud](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/selfhosted-apps-06-2025/#third-party-cloud-nc-backup).

In [Sept25](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/selfhosted-apps-sept-2025/#hello-again-firebat): I combined NC + Traefik https + Tailscale - which is a lovely setup.

But just in case you dont want to mess with databases, lets see some other Filebrowser alternatives and FTPs:
