**Tl;DR**

Dont have the time to learn, neither the willing to pay for custom?

Benefit from what's automated for the masses.

+++ Selfhosting [Postgres](#selfhost-postgres) 101

**Intro**

I want to **combine a Landing x PaaS Tool**s to enable B2C users to get up to speed quickly with certain services that dont require any customization.

A Micro-SaaS on Top of PaaS x (SSG + CMS + other services TBC)

Not trying to do a:

* https://railway.com/pricing
* elestio

But if you dont have the time to read/learn, neither willingness to pay a DFY:

So im going to take one of these PaaS:

Simple, uh?

## Creating a DIY PaaS Offering

The **launch strategy**: *aka, focus strategy*

| Element | Decision |
| :--- | :--- |
| **One Avatar** | Undicided people w/o a clear way how to proceed|
| **One Product** | Simple knowledge to vibe code effectively|
| **One Channel** | Forums like reddit|

The **Tier of Service**: DIY (1b - *leverages on tech*)

The **Lead Magnet**: get a FREE web audit *leveraging the discoveries done [here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/do-your-instagram/#web-audits)*

The **tech stack**: 

| Requirement | Specification | Clarification / Decision |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend Framework** | | Tab favicon and og must be available |
| **Styling/UI Library** | | |
| **[Backend](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/docs/dev/fe-vs-be/)/Database** | | |
| **[Authentication](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/docs/dev/authentication/)** | | |
| Others | Web Analytics / ads / Cal / Formbricks / ESP | Yes, via MailTrap |

* TAM: *not estimated*
* LTV: *not estimated*
* CaC: ~0$, wont be promoted directly
* Supply: scalable via server resources

Why...am I doing this then?

To *hopefully* move away from "selling time" (which caps your income) to "selling value" (which creates scale).

## FAQ

### Selfhost Postgres

I read this fantastic [post about selfhosting postgres](https://pierce.dev/notes/go-ahead-self-host-postgres?ref=selfh.st).

And how could I not addit to the mix.

As PG is [one of the DBs](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/setup-databases-docker/) that you can set in your servers to do D&A or as a companion to many services.

And [pgsql can do](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/setup-databases-docker/#postgresql) several parts of a tech stack all together

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Home-Lab/tree/main/postgresql" title="Postgres | Docker Config 🐋 ↗" >}}
  {{< card link="https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/databases/" title="DB | Docs ↗" icon="book-open" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

```sh
docker compose up -d

#docker exec postgres_container psql -U admin -d myapp -c "SELECT 1;"

docker exec -it postgres_container psql -U admin -d myapp
#SELECT version();
#\dt       -- List tables (empty for now)
#\q        -- Quit
```

Let's use it with [the sample **chinook DB**](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database/releases): *yes, im cooking sth on top of LangChain+DBs again*

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/langchain-chat-with-database" title="Chat with DBs ↗" icon="book-open" >}}
  {{< card link="https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/how-to-chat-with-your-data/" title="Chat with CSVs ↗" icon="book-open" >}}  
{{< /cards >}}

This is all you need to ***plug* an existing database** into your just created **PGSQL container instance**:

```sh
curl -L -O https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database/releases/download/v1.4.5/Chinook_PostgreSql.sql
cat Chinook_PostgreSql.sql | docker exec -i postgres_container psql -U admin -d myapp

docker exec postgres_container psql -U admin -d myapp -c "\l"

docker exec postgres_container psql -U admin -d chinook -c "\dt"

docker exec -it postgres_container psql -U admin -d chinook
#\dt
#SELECT * FROM artist LIMIT 5;
```

We will be using this very soon :)

The Case for Self-Hosting

1. The "Cloud Myth"

Cloud providers (like AWS RDS) pitch reliability and expertise as their main value. However, Freeman points out:

* **Identical Engines:** Managed services usually run the same open-source Postgres you can download yourself.
* **False Security:** Managed services also experience outages. When they do, you have fewer tools to fix the problem than if you owned the infrastructure.
* **Cost Gap:** As of 2025, cloud pricing has become aggressive. A mid-tier RDS instance can cost over $300/month, while a dedicated server for the same price offers vastly superior hardware (e.g., 32 cores vs. 4 vCPUs).

2. Operational Reality

Freeman shares his experience running a self-hosted DB for two years, serving millions of queries daily. He notes that maintenance is surprisingly low-effort:

* **Weekly:** 10 mins (Checking backups and logs).
* **Monthly:** 30 mins (Security updates and capacity planning).
* **Quarterly:** 2 hours (Optional tuning and disaster recovery tests).

3. When to Self-Host (and When Not To)

* **Self-Host If:** You are past the "vibe coding" startup phase but aren't a massive enterprise yet. It’s the "sweet spot" for most apps.
* **Stick to Managed If:** You are a total beginner, a massive corporation with enough budget to outsource the labor, or you have strict regulatory compliance needs (HIPAA, FedRAMP).


If you choose to self-host, Freeman emphasizes that standard Docker defaults aren't enough. 

You must tune these three areas:

Memory & Performance Tuning

* **`shared_buffers`**: Set to ~25% of RAM.
* **`effective_cache_size`**: Set to ~75% of RAM to help the query planner.
* **`work_mem`**: Be conservative to avoid running out of memory during complex sorts.

Connection Management

* **Avoid Direct Connections:** Postgres connections are "expensive."
* **Use PgBouncer:** Use a connection pooler by default to handle parallelism efficiently, especially for Python or async applications.

Storage Optimization

* **NVMe Settings:** Modern SSDs change the math on query planning. You should lower `random_page_cost` (to ~1.1) to tell Postgres that random reads are nearly as fast as sequential ones.
