**Intro**

Few months back, I tested Logto Python SDK: [here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/testing-tinyauth/#logto-authentication) and [here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/using-stripe-with-flask/#stripe-x-logto)

It was working perfectly, as you can see on the related source code:

But I want to compare kneck to kneck with couple of new *architectures* ive been learning along the way.

The question today is: **Can i use Logto JS SDK + SSG Themes + CF Workers** to get a blueprint/skeleton/template for my SaaS?
