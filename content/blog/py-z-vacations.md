Some time ago, I made a [Trip Planner Web App](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Py_Trip_Planner), based purely on weather patterns as [described here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/trip-planner-with-weather/).

If you are tired of this:

![Karting Adventure](/blog_img/memes/oldnewjob.jpg)

Why not taking a break in between?

{{< details title="[How to] Spin the Python Trip Planner! üìå" closed="true" >}}

* Follow the [repo instructions](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Py_Trip_Planner/tree/main/Deploy)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Py_Trip_Planner && cd ./Py_Trip_Planner

#docker build -t trip_planner .
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --no-cache --progress=plain -t trip_planner .

docker run -d \
  --name tripplanner \
  -p 8051:8050 \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  trip_planner #ghcr.io/jalcocert/py_trip_planner #fossengineer/trip_planner
```

Or...Use the following **docker compose**:

```yml
version: "2"
services:
  tripplanner:
    image: trip_planner #ghcr.io/jalcocert/py_trip_planner #fossengineer/trip_planner
    container_name: tripplanner
    ports:
      - 8051:8050
    restart: unless-stopped
```

But we need something more to decide **where and how to go next**.

**THE USE CASE** - Plan a Trip To MRK

<!-- 
* Hotel 
  * Avenue Houmane El Fatouaki, 30 APT N¬∞1, Marrakech, Medina, 40000 Marrakesh, Morocco
  * https://maps.app.goo.gl/PuPUZhHAykdFYrVa6
* Marrakesh Menara Airport - RAK
* To see in MRK
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saadian_Tombs - 700m from Hotel
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahia_Palace - 600m
  * Madrasa Ben Youssef - 1.5KM
  * El Badi Palace - 1.6km
  * https://el-fenn.com/majorelle-gardens/ - 3km
* City Break
  * Ouzoud Waterfalls - 150KM - https://www.viator.com/tours/Marrakech/Ouzoud-Waterfalls-Full-Day-Trip-from-Marrakech/d5408-7674P21
  * Essaouira Athlantic Coast - 250km
   
To get to Essaouira, the coastal city from Marrakech, you have a few options:

1. Bus:

CTM: This is a reliable and affordable option. There's one departure per day, taking about 3 hours.
Supratours: Offers multiple daily departures, also taking around 3 hours.
2. Taxi:

A faster option, taking about 2.5 hours. However, it's more expensive.
3. Rental Car:

Gives you the most flexibility to explore the scenic route and stop at your own pace.
Time Zone:

Morocco is on Western European Time (WET), which is the same as CET.

Currency:

The currency in Morocco is the Moroccan Dirham (MAD). As of November 2023, the exchange rate is approximately 10 Moroccan Dirham to 1 US Dollar. However, exchange rates fluctuate, so it's best to check the current rate before your trip.

## FAQ

### How to's about SQLite

SQLite is a very handy and portable DB to place some logs.

{{< details title="Storing in SQLite üìå" closed="true" >}}


{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="Reading SQLite üìå" closed="true" >}}


{{< /details >}}


And now, there is even a fork of it

{{< youtube "PGpL5hYpY1o" >}}

{{< details title="More about SQLite Fork - libSQL [Optimized for AI] üìå" closed="true" >}}

SQLite is the most deployed database in history, with over **1 trillion active users**. It was developed 25 years ago by **Richard Hipp** for a **US Navy damage control system**. This lightweight database is contained in a single **600 KB file**, requires **no server process**, and is an essential part of many modern applications.

Although **SQLite** is in the **public domain**, its development is managed by just **three people**, with **no outside contributions** allowed. Despite these limitations, SQLite has become ubiquitous due to its simplicity and reliability.

In **October 2022**, a new fork called **libSQL** was introduced, with a focus on **community-controlled development**. It retains **SQL-like compatibility** with SQLite, but introduces new features to address some of SQLite‚Äôs limitations.

Key features of **libSQL**:
- **One database per user**: This approach could **improve performance**, **reduce latency**, and **enhance security**.
- **Server mode**: Allows access to the database via **HTTP**.
- **Native replication system**: Enables embedded **replica features**.
- **Encryption at rest**: Adds an extra layer of **security** for data storage.
- **Web Assembly triggers**: Lets you run **code when specific events** occur in the database.
- **Shared schema across multiple databases**: Makes it easier to manage databases together.
- **Vector queries**: Optimized for **AI applications**, enabling complex data operations.

Benefits and Challenges of libSQL:
- **Performance**: The one-database-per-user model can significantly **boost performance** and reduce **latency**, but it may create challenges with **data retrieval** and **combining data** across different locations.
- **Security**: Enhanced **security** through encryption and the isolated nature of individual user databases.
- However, retrieving and combining data from different databases may **not be practical** in all cases, especially when data is spread across geographically distant locations.

In conclusion, **libSQL** brings significant improvements over **SQLite** by offering a more **flexible, community-driven approach** to database management. With its new features and robust capabilities, it has the potential to **revolutionize** how we build and manage databases, especially for applications requiring high **performance**, **security**, and **AI integration**.

SQLite may be **underappreciated**, but with libSQL, it becomes even more powerful and adaptable to modern needs.

You can explore a SQLite via a script, like we did [during the Scrapping Post](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/scrap-and-chat-with-the-web/#old-school-scrapping)

There is a cool project for this - https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser

**sqlitebrowser** - DB Browser for SQLite (DB4S) is an open-source tool for creating, designing, and editing SQLite database files.

It simplifies database management for users and developers, eliminating the need for complex SQL commands.

**Key Features:**

- Visual interface resembling a spreadsheet.

- Allows creation and modification of database files.

- Supports searching, editing, and deleting database records.

- Facilitates importing/exporting of data in various formats (CSV, SQL).

- Offers SQL query capabilities with result inspection.

- Provides graphical plotting of data.

**Key Information:**

- Continuous and nightly builds are available for download.

- Compatible with Windows, macOS, Linux, and FreeBSD.

- Installation options include package managers like Chocolatey, Homebrew, and Snap.

- The project has a rich history of community contributions and updates.

**Conclusions:**

DB4S is a valuable tool for users needing an intuitive interface for SQLite database management. 

**Similar Projects:**

- DBeaver: A universal database tool for developers.

- HeidiSQL: A lightweight SQL client for MySQL, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.
