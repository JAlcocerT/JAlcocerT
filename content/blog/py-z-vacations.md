Its all about **Knowledge of Crowds**

Some time ago, I made a [Trip Planner Web App](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Py_Trip_Planner), based purely on weather patterns as [described here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/trip-planner-with-weather/).


But we need something more to decide where and how to go next.

### Interactivity & Maps with Streamlit

This is a really cool **new feature from Streamlit**.



### The Agents

Its been a while since I got to know about [**CrewAI**](https://fossengineer.com/ai-agents-crewai/)

Not its time to do something with it

### How to's about SQLite

SQLite is a very handy and portable DB to place some logs.

And now, there is even a fork of it

{{< youtube "PGpL5hYpY1o" >}}

{{< details title="More about SQLite Fork - libSQL [Optimized for AI] üìå" closed="true" >}}

SQLite is the most deployed database in history, with over **1 trillion active users**. It was developed 25 years ago by **Richard Hipp** for a **US Navy damage control system**. This lightweight database is contained in a single **600 KB file**, requires **no server process**, and is an essential part of many modern applications.

Although **SQLite** is in the **public domain**, its development is managed by just **three people**, with **no outside contributions** allowed. Despite these limitations, SQLite has become ubiquitous due to its simplicity and reliability.

In **October 2022**, a new fork called **libSQL** was introduced, with a focus on **community-controlled development**. It retains **SQL-like compatibility** with SQLite, but introduces new features to address some of SQLite‚Äôs limitations.

### Key features of **libSQL**:
- **One database per user**: This approach could **improve performance**, **reduce latency**, and **enhance security**.
- **Server mode**: Allows access to the database via **HTTP**.
- **Native replication system**: Enables embedded **replica features**.
- **Encryption at rest**: Adds an extra layer of **security** for data storage.
- **Web Assembly triggers**: Lets you run **code when specific events** occur in the database.
- **Shared schema across multiple databases**: Makes it easier to manage databases together.
- **Vector queries**: Optimized for **AI applications**, enabling complex data operations.

### Benefits and Challenges of libSQL:
- **Performance**: The one-database-per-user model can significantly **boost performance** and reduce **latency**, but it may create challenges with **data retrieval** and **combining data** across different locations.
- **Security**: Enhanced **security** through encryption and the isolated nature of individual user databases.
- However, retrieving and combining data from different databases may **not be practical** in all cases, especially when data is spread across geographically distant locations.

In conclusion, **libSQL** brings significant improvements over **SQLite** by offering a more **flexible, community-driven approach** to database management. With its new features and robust capabilities, it has the potential to **revolutionize** how we build and manage databases, especially for applications requiring high **performance**, **security**, and **AI integration**.

SQLite may be **underappreciated**, but with libSQL, it becomes even more powerful and adaptable to modern needs.
