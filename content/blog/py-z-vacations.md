Its all about **Knowledge of Crowds**

Some time ago, I made a [Trip Planner Web App](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Py_Trip_Planner), based purely on weather patterns as [described here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/trip-planner-with-weather/).


But we need something more to decide where and how to go next.
