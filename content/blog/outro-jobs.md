## Data for Job Market

We will need some **data to make this work**.

Last year, I was tinkering with **scrapping tools**:

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/scrap-and-chat-with-the-web/" title="Scrapping the Web" image="/videos/job_offers.png" subtitle="Post where I tinkered with scrapping tools." >}}
  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Scrap_Tools" title="Scrapping Tools" image="/blog_img/apps/gh-jalcocert.svg" subtitle="Source Code. Using BS4, AI Scraps like Firecrawl..." >}}
{{< /cards >}}

This post will be a continuation of the learnings gain in there.


### Using BS4 and CRON

It was all very simple, very clear...

Clone this repo, go to the folder where the magic happens:

```sh
git clone https://gitlab.com/fossengineer1/cv-check
cd Scrap_Pracuj
```

> Until it does not work anymore :)

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="https://gitlab.com/fossengineer1/cv-check" title="CV-Check" image="/blog_img/apps/gh-jalcocert.svg" subtitle="Testing CVs with AI/LLMs" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

```sh
#git clone https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Scrap_Tools
```

**Exploring SQLite**

After you have been **running the script for a few days**...

```sh
python3 -m venv scrap_remote_offers_venv
source scrap_remote_offers_venv/bin/activate

#./run_pracuj.sh
#/home/reisipi/dirty_repositories/cv-check/Scrap_Pracuj/run_pracuj.sh

#just with python would do the same
python3 pracuj_v3.py
```

You would **see in the DB** that...

```sh
sudo apt install sqlite3
sqlite3 --version
```

{{< details title="See SQLiteDB Job History 📌" closed="true" >}}

We will have records:

```sh
sqlite3 ./job_offers_v3.db
#sqlite3 /home/reisipi/dirty_repositories/cv-check/Scrap_Pracuj/job_offers_v3.db

#SELECT * FROM your_table_name ORDER BY your_primary_key_column DESC LIMIT 5;

#SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';
#.tables

SELECT * FROM job_offers;
SELECT * FROM job_offers ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 5;

#.quit
```
{{< /details >}}

...now there are... **no offers?!**


![BS4 not working](/blog_img/apps/job-history/bs4-job-not-working.png)


{{< callout type="warning" >}}
It seems that there was a **change on the web structure...**
{{< /callout >}}


### Fixing BS4 Driven Data

Going back to the url and inspecting it...

I could see that the `<span class="...` where the information was passed, had changed.

```py
offers_element = soup.find('span', class_='listing_j1fjdh9e') #just tweaking this
```

But making it work again for the remote data, was not that easy.


{{< details title="Only with bs4 📌" closed="true" >}}


It was all about using **the filtered link**:

```py
remote_selector = ("span", "class", "listing_j1p29tao")  # Or whatever the correct one is!
remote_offers = get_job_offer_count(remote_url, remote_selector)
```

> up to v4 and v6 again, its just with **BS4**.

{{< /details >}}

> So I switched gears

### Improving Reliability

Hello again, **FireCrawl**

{{< cards cols="1" >}}
  {{< card link="https://www.firecrawl.dev" title="FireCrawl API ↗ " >}}
  {{< card link="https://docs.firecrawl.dev/features/scrape#extracting-without-schema-new" title="API Docs ↗" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

Im using the latest feature, extract: https://docs.firecrawl.dev/features/extract

So now the v5 works with bs4 and firecrawl:

```py
# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Initialize FirecrawlApp (do this *outside* the function)
app = FirecrawlApp(api_key=os.getenv("FIRECRAWL_API_KEY"))

class ExtractSchema(BaseModel):
    praca_zdalna: int

def get_zdalna_count(url):
    """Extracts 'praca zdalna' count using Firecrawl."""
    try:
        data = app.extract([url], {
            'prompt': 'Extract the number of praca zdalna offered on this website.',
            'schema': ExtractSchema.model_json_schema(),
        })

        try:
            praca_zdalna_count = data['data']['praca_zdalna']
            #print(praca_zdalna_count)  # Output: 2602

        except (KeyError, TypeError):  # Combine the exceptions for brevity
            print("Error: 'data' or 'praca_zdalna' key not found, or data is not a dictionary.")
            praca_zdalna_count = 0  # Or handle the error as you see fit.  Returning 0 is a common approach.
        return praca_zdalna_count

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return 0  # Return 0 to indicate failure
```

### BS4 + FireCrawl + Telegram

What if...bs4 is the default and firecrawl just saves us provisionally?


### Server and CRON

**Cron Job** for the server.


{{< callout type="info" >}}
You might need **SSH Keys setup** 
{{< /callout >}}


```sh
#https://gitlab.com/-/user_settings/ssh_keys
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

ssh -T git@gitlab.com
```

```sh
#export SSH_PRIVATE_KEY=~/.ssh/your_private_key
git clone git@gitlab.com:fossengineer1/cv-check.git
```

```sh
cd cv-check/Scrap_Pracuj
nano run_pracuj_v3.sh
pwd

chmod +x /home/reisipi/cv-check/Scrap_Pracuj/run_pracuj_v3.sh
./run_pracuj_v3.sh
```

```sh
#python -m venv scrap_remote_offers_venv
python3 -m venv scrap_remote_offers_venv

#Unix
source scrap_remote_offers_venv/bin/activate
#Windows
#.\scrap_remote_offers_venv\Scripts\activate
```

```sh
#pip install -U kaleido requests bs4
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 pracuj_v6.py
```

Now, CRON will execute the script **every day**:

```sh
crontab -e
#0 0 * * * /path/to/your/run_pracuj.sh >> /path/to/your/logfile.log 2>&1
0 23 * * * /home/reisipi/cv-check/Scrap_Pracuj/run_pracuj_v3.sh
```

See that **the CRON job is there**:

```sh
crontab -l
#python3 pracuj_v3.py >> /home/reisipi/dirty_repositories/cv-check/Scrap_Pracuj/script_output.log 2>&1
```

#### For BAs/PMs

These are excellent and comprehensive questions for a BA/PM interview preparation. 

They cover core competencies essential for success in both roles. 

Here's a breakdown of why each question is effective and what to focus on when answering them.

**Accountability: Leading and Taking Responsibility for Projects**
