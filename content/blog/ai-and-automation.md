Just recently I covered how to [build a quick product with auth + a landing](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/micro-saas/)

Also, couple of [marketer show me a cool workflow](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/software-for-marketing-agencies/)

If you read me for some time already, you are also aware of APIs, Webhooks and automations (not only with n8n)

How can this all be put together?

I mean...a ,custom' solution that provides out of the box a UI for the final user.
