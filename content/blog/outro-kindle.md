**TL;DR**

A recap on the last **~5y+ of kindles notes.**

Pandoc can do very cool things.

**Intro**

Being able to **create a ebook** as a code and having a website to publish it is great.

But if you have consumed ebooks that other has written, you will have a lot of clippins.

Those notes saved for years.

Just waiting for you to get and read them.

So this is mostly a create + understand notes from kindle.

Rather than a way to admire how people have created **static status pages**: https://open-slum.pages.dev/ nor [get things](https://annas-archive.org/).

### Kindle Notes to AI

Kindle notes are saved into a `.txt` in the device.

I was storing notes for few years already and im really curious to see whats inside.


Some time back I saw:

* https://github.com/mckaywrigley/kindle-gpt


But in the meantime, there were news:

> I gave it a try with Google's NotebookLLM, now even Perplexity can help you upload that txt and clear them...

> > Custom is custom, but...would it be better out of the box?

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Kindles files wont be recognized unless you use a proper microUSB data cable. You can access their content via `https://read.amazon.com/landing`

### Parsing the notes via Python

As simple as this:

```sh
python extract_notes.py "Brainfluence" brainfluence_notes.txt
```

## Conclusions

With this, you will be able to create and distribute via epublibre or amazon `https://www.amazon.es/sendtokindle`.

Recently I wrote about note taking tools and [how to build your KB/Knowledge Base](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/knowledge-management/#knowledge-management-tools).

As I cant stop being impressed by **all we can achieve with simple markdown**...

1. With **Pandoc** you can create pdf from your .md as seen on [this *Jira* post](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/jira-data-model-with-ai/#md-to-pdf).

```sh
python3 test-pandoc.py

# Replace emojis with text equivalents
sed 's/✅/[OK]/g; s/❌/[X]/g; s/��/[CHART]/g' jira-pdm-req2tech.md > input-clean.md
pandoc input-clean.md -o jira-estimation.pdf --pdf-engine=xelatex --toc
```

And pushing to epub kindle compatible is also fine.

You can also try with [these tools](#converting-to-epub)


2. Katex is also great

3. Recently, I got to know about Typst [here](https://atareao.es/podcast/todavia-sufres-con-word-para-hacer-tu-tesis-o-proyecto-usa-typst/)

**KaTeX** and **[Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst)** serve entirely different purposes, so the comparison isn't about which is "better," but which is appropriate for a given task.

* **KaTeX is a JavaScript library** for rendering mathematical notation in web browsers.
* **Typst is a complete, modern document typesetting system** and programming language designed to replace LaTeX.

| Feature | KaTeX | Typst |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Goal** | Fast, high-quality **math rendering** for the web (HTML/JavaScript). | Complete, modern **document typesetting** (compiles to PDF). |
| **Scope** | Math-only. | Full documents (text, math, figures, tables, bibliography, etc.). |
| **Output** | HTML/CSS. | PDF. |
| **Input Syntax** | **LaTeX math syntax** (`\frac{1}{2}`, `\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}`). | **Custom, simplified markup language** for text, with its own math mode syntax (`sum_(n=1)^oo 1/n`). |
| **Speed** | Extremely fast rendering on a web page. | Extremely fast compilation to PDF (often much faster than LaTeX). |
| **Customization/Extensibility**| Limited (focus on speed and core math support). | High (uses a built-in scripting/programming language for layouts and templates). |


KaTeX is optimized for speed and fidelity on the web. It's meant to take an existing math expression (using LaTeX syntax) and display it beautifully in a web page without relying on a server.

* **Pros:** **Blazing fast**, produces high-quality, non-janky math, and has a very small footprint.
* **Cons:** **Math only**. It cannot render full documents, handle complex layouts, or process general LaTeX commands (only the math subset).

Typst is a holistic tool aiming to modernize document creation. It's designed to be more intuitive and robust than LaTeX, using a clean markup that integrates better with a powerful scripting language.

* **Pros:** **Excellent developer experience** (simple syntax, good error messages, near-instant compilation/live preview), **superior programming capabilities** for complex layout and template creation, and native PDF output.
* **Cons:** **Young ecosystem** (fewer specialized packages and journal templates compared to LaTeX), and a **new math syntax** that requires learning even for existing LaTeX users. Typst's math rendering is a component of the whole system, not a specialized web library like KaTeX.


* Use **KaTeX** when you have a **website or application** and need to display math formulas quickly to the user.
* Use **Typst** when you need to **write a document** (a paper, thesis, report, book) and generate a final PDF file.
