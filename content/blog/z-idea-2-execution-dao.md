**TL;DR**

Is this what future will look like?

**Intro**

Imagine whats next when LLMs/Agents can go from general ideas to epic/tasks

And from tasks to solutions

## What is desirable?

How will agents know what to do?

Or better: How will they know what other agents might find useful?

Pure randomness?

Or...Information?

If so: Which information?

Many people dont agree that Prices are amazing signals that consolidate huge data points.

I doubt that agents would skip the power of Prices.


So, whats stopping them from: *Data -> Decision -> Delivery* ?


### Price = Data

### Agentic Stories

### Agentic SDLC

### Agentic Delivery


#### Crypto and DAO

Few years ago I got to know about ENS where you could buy forever a domain.

One of such domains were .dao which is decentralized autonomous organization.

This gets crazy when we put together all previous points.

## Conclusions

Are we moving forward to such future?

I just can say that at this point of interacting for few years with LLMs I have more questions than answers.

But as I see it: these questions are having higher quality.

Or at least: im more aware of my hypothesis and blinds spots / converging logics

> After all...those ,failed' vibe coded PoCs were just a miss from my initial ask and clarifications

## FAQ

The context to move forward comes from:

* Questions
* The reply *based on ,mental' models* that we (or agents) give to them
