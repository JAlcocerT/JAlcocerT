Its been few months since I covered [these Tools for forms/newsletters](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/blog/dev-forms/)

Now, how to built great products?

What it is our potential client? What does it values the most? what are their *pain points*?


Given that you have a cool website, already with web analytics.

People are reading, so...what are they interested at?

You got to know about that thanks to a [newsletter/forms](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/blog/dev-forms/).

> From those I enjoyed [formbricks](https://formbricks.com/) and [Mailerlite](https://accounts.mailerlite.com/login), which can be integrated with Gsheets/[cal](https://cal.com/)/webhooks as seen [here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/blog/dev-forms/#formbricks)

Or maybe you had some kind of **waiting list** in place.

## Product First
