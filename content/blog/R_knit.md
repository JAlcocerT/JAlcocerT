## The R Knit Package

Lately I found [the knitr package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/index.html/ "GH {rel='nofollow'}") on R bloggers and interestingly, there are people who use R directly to create updated figures on their websites, including their latest data discovieries.

You can find a great documentation here for **Knitr**:

> Create Dynamic Documents with R and KnitR

## Install and use KnitR

Install it with:

```r
install.packages('knitr')
```

And once your `.Rmd` document is ready, you have to **simply execute** the following:

```r
#knitt the specified file on its current folder to test its view
rmarkdown::render('YourFile.Rmd',
                  output_file = paste('index', 
                                      '.html', sep=''))
```

After executing this, a new file `index.html` will be created - This is **your new Static Site**.

With the [Knitr package and Rmarkdown](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/knitr/versions/1.45) - It is not a SSG, but it can render html from markdown, which can be seen as a Web in GithubPages
