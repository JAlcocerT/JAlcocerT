Because some time ago (pre vibe-coding age) I tried flutter.

And it was not that easy.

**Tl;DR**

Couple years ago I tried to do some Flet Apps with chatGPT, but the knowledge was not there.

How about now?

To write **Flutter from Python**, you can use the Flet framework. Flet is a Python library that allows you to build Flutter apps without having to write any Dart code.

To use Flet, you first need to install it using pip:

```sh
pip install flet #https://pypi.org/project/flet/
```

```py
app = flet.App()
```

Once you have created the flet.App object, you can start adding widgets to it. To do this, you use the flet.App.add() method. For example, to add a button to your app, you would use the following code:


Yes, **Flet can generate static pages**.

In fact, this is one of its main strengths.

Flet uses a technology called Pyodide to compile your Python code into [WebAssembly](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/wasm/), which is a binary format that can be executed in any web browser. This means that you can deploy your Flet app to any **static web hosting service**, such as **Firebase, GH Pages or CF Pages**.

To generate a static page from your Flet app, simply run the following command:

```sh
flet publish
```

This will create a directory called build that contains all of the static files for your app. You can then deploy these files to any static web hosting service.

Here are some of the benefits of generating static pages with Flet:

* Performance: Static pages are much faster than dynamic pages because they do not need to be rendered on the server. This makes Flet apps a good choice for websites that need to be able to handle a lot of traffic.
* Security: Static pages are also more secure than dynamic pages because they are not vulnerable to server-side attacks.
* Portability: Static pages can be deployed to any web server, including cheap and shared hosting plans. This makes Flet apps a good choice for websites that need to be able to scale to handle a lot of traffic.


Overall, Flet is a great choice for developers who are looking for a fast, efficient, and secure way to generate static pages.

### Desktop Alternatives in Python

If targeting desktop instead of web:

| Framework | Description | Ideal For |
|------------|--------------|-----------|
| Tkinter | Built-in, simple GUI | Beginners |
| PyQt / PySide | Complex, cross-platform | Professional apps |
| Kivy | Touch apps across devices | Mobile + desktop |
| wxPython | Native-look GUIs | OS-integrated apps |
| Flet | Flutter-like experience for desktop & web | Unified apps |


When it comes to building desktop applications with Python, there are several frameworks available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

Here's a breakdown of some of the most popular options:

**Key Python GUI Frameworks:**

* **Tkinter:**
    * This is Python's standard GUI toolkit.
    * It's relatively easy to learn and is included with most Python installations, making it a good choice for beginners.
    * However, its appearance can be somewhat dated.
    * Good for simple applications.
    * Ive tinkered with it [here](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/YT-Video-Edition/tree/main/VideoApp_tkinter)

{{< /cards >}}

* **PyQt/PySide:**
    * These frameworks provide Python bindings for the Qt library, a powerful cross-platform GUI toolkit.
    * They offer a wide range of widgets and customization options, allowing you to create sophisticated and visually appealing applications.
    * PyQt has licensing considerations, while PySide is LGPL-licensed.
    * Excellent for complex applications.
* **Kivy:**
    * Kivy is designed for creating cross-platform applications with a focus on touch-enabled interfaces.
    * It's suitable for developing applications that can run on desktop and mobile platforms.
    * Good for multi-touch applications.
* **wxPython:**
    * wxPython provides Python bindings for the wxWidgets library, which allows you to create native-looking applications on various platforms.
    * It offers a good balance of features and performance.
    * Good for applications that need to have a native operating system look and feel.
* **Flet:**
    * Flet is a framework that enables you to build cross platform applications, including desktop applications. It is based on flutter, and allows for very quick UI development.

* https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/

**Key Considerations:**

* **Cross-platform compatibility:** If you need your application to run on multiple operating systems, choose a framework that supports cross-platform development.
* **Complexity:** Consider the complexity of your application and choose a framework that matches your needs. Tkinter is suitable for simple applications, while PyQt/PySide and wxPython are better for more complex ones.
* **Appearance:** If you want your application to have a modern and visually appealing interface, PyQt/PySide or Kivy might be good choices.
* **Licensing:** Be aware of the licensing terms of the framework you choose, especially if you plan to distribute your application commercially.

    * Under the hood, NiceGUI uses JustPy, which in turn is built on top of Starlette (an asynchronous ASGI framework) and other web technologies.
    *  library to write simple graphical user interfaces in Python we discovered JustPy. Although we liked the approach, it is too "low-level HTML" for our daily usage. But it inspired us to use **Vue and Quasar** for the frontend.

    * **Allows WebSockets**


    REST API (HTTP):
        RESTful APIs are widely used for communication between clients and servers over HTTP.
        They are well-suited for request-response interactions and are easy to understand and implement.
        However, they may not be the best choice for real-time communication as they are based on the request-response model, which can introduce latency and overhead for real-time updates.
        REST APIs are suitable for scenarios where real-time updates are not critical or where the frequency of updates is low.

    WebSockets:
        WebSockets provide full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, enabling real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers.
        They offer low-latency, high-performance communication and are well-suited for applications requiring real-time updates, such as chat applications, live dashboards, and multiplayer games.
        WebSockets can be more complex to implement compared to REST APIs, but they offer significant benefits for real-time applications.

We have built on top of FastAPI, which itself is based on the ASGI framework Starlette and the ASGI webserver Uvicorn because of their great performance and ease of use.
* JustPY
    * JustPy is an object-oriented, component based, high-level Python Web Framework that requires no front-end programming. With a few lines of only Python code, you can create interactive websites without any JavaScript programming. JustPy can also be used to create graphic user interfaces for Python programs.

#### Python for Web Assembly

WebAssembly (often abbreviated as Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine.

It's designed as a portable compilation target for high-level languages like C, C++, Rust, and now, even Python, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications. In simpler terms, 

> WebAssembly allows you to run code written in languages other than JavaScript on the web at near-native speed.

#### What it is Pyodide?

Pyodide is a Python distribution for the browser and Node.js based on WebAssembly.

Pyodide is a port of CPython to WebAssembly/Emscripten.

Pyodide makes it possible to install and run Python packages in the browser with micropip.

Any pure Python package with a wheel available on PyPI is supported. Many packages with C extensions have also been ported for use with Pyodide.
