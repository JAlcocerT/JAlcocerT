## Enterprise Insights

We are going to simulate these with containers.

Just as demostrated here with pgsql.

### TSQL

### Oracle SQL

### Using BAML

I was testing BAML last year [here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/ai-tools-for-cli/#baml).

And it resonated a lot with the way langchain generates the query to the databases.

So could not resist to explore how to do a custom and more controlable solution around BAML.

### UI Wrapper

To make the solution sellable to enterprises, we need a UI.
