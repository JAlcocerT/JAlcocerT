**Tl;DR**

Prospecting is more important than proposals.

**Intro**



We come from [here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/custom-re-rag), where I made a custom solution without accounting even for opportunity cost.

This one starts with the end: targeting sales for b2b real estate agencies.

- **Result**: You learn exactly what features they need. $1,000 - $3,000 per setup.
- **Pricing**: **$1,000 - $3,000 (One-Time Setup Fee)** + **$100 - $300 (Monthly Maintenance)**.

#### Why this pricing?
1. **The "Expert" Barrier**: You are solving a complex problem (Scraping + AI + SSR). If they could do it for $100, they would have. The $1k+ price tag signals that this is a **Managed Enterprise Solution**.
2. **Filtering**: It filters out the "difficult" clients who want the world for $100. A client who pays $1k+ respects your time.
3. **Cash Flow**: This covers the 2-5 hours of manual work you put into initial configuration, DNS, and styling.
4. **Maintenance (The Value Loop)**: The monthly fee covers the server cost, OpenAI tokens, and the "scraper maintenance" (since real estate portals change their HTML often).


## The Business Idea

| Stage | Activity | Margin Level | Strategic Goal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Attraction** | AI Marketing / Branding | ** (OpEx)** | Build the "AI Expert" reputation so you can charge a higher **Price ()**. |
| **Conversion** | Sales & Account Mgmt | ** (OpEx)** | Increase the **Volume ()** of AI-specific contracts. |
| **Delivery** | Developers + AI Tools | ** (COGS)** | Use AI tools to increase efficiency, keeping the **Gross Margin** high even after giving **Pay Raises**. |



### The Attraction - Leads

### The Conversion -  via Fantastic Landing

This goes with my latest favourite stack life to date.

### The Delivery

This is actually all the software that already existed.

I just do the 121 onboarding.
