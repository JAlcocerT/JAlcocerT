To give some cool functionality to static websites, we can use **some tricks**.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
  It is beneficial to [review some CSS Tricks](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/blog/dev-css/)
{{< /callout >}}

## Newsletters

### Keila

OhMyForm is Discontinued, but...

* **Keila** https://github.com/pentacent/keila - aGPL

>  Open Source Newsletter Tool. 


{{< dropdown title="Keila Setup Docker ⏬" closed="true" >}}

* https://hub.docker.com/r/pentacent/keila/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated - X86 only

```yml
# This docker-compose file is intended for local testing and NOT intended to be
# production ready.

version: "3"

services:
  keila:
    image: pentacent/keila:latest
    ports:
      - "4000:4000"
    depends_on:
      - mariadb
    build:
      context: ../
      dockerfile: ops/Dockerfile
    environment:
      SECRET_KEY_BASE: "${YOUR_SECRET_KEY}"
      DB_URL: "mysql://root:password@mariadb/keila"
      URL_HOST: "${YOUR_URL_HOST}"
      MAILER_SMTP_HOST: "${YOUR_MAILER_SMTP_HOST}"
      MAILER_SMTP_USER: "${YOUR_MAILER_SMTP_USER}"
      MAILER_SMTP_PASSWORD: "${YOUR_MAILER_SMTP_PASSWORD}"

  mariadb:
    image: mariadb:latest
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
      MYSQL_DATABASE: keila

```
{{< /dropdown >}}

### Mailchimp

You ll still need a back end to process the calls (if you are using static sites)

### MailerLite

Another option is [MailerLite](https://www.mailerlite.com/invite/225babb421546).

It can help you collect emails with **signup forms and send Newsletters, also marketing campaigns.**

They can work as **pop-ups or as embedded forms**.

> At the time of writing, mailerlite is free up to 1k subs. They also have an email API, [mailersend](https://www.mailerlite.com/pricing-mailersend)

{{< details title="Setup MailerLite 📌" closed="true" >}}

You will need to authenticate that you own the email and also the domain (with DNS).

Go to your [mailerlite dashboard UI](https://dashboard.mailerlite.com)

I am using Cloudflare for that domain, and the DNS were updated automatically via UI.

There are some **CName and txt records** and they will be **DNS only**, not proxied.

![Wordpress Google Page Speed Desktop](/blog_img/web/SaaS/mailerlite-domainsetup.png)

**Create a new form** and you will get the JS to place before the `</head>` of your web.

```js
<!-- MailerLite Universal -->
<script>
    (function(w,d,e,u,f,l,n){w[f]=w[f]||function(){(w[f].q=w[f].q||[])
    .push(arguments);},l=d.createElement(e),l.async=1,l.src=u,
    n=d.getElementsByTagName(e)[0],n.parentNode.insertBefore(l,n);})
    (window,document,'script','https://assets.mailerlite.com/js/universal.js','ml');
    ml('account', 'some_acount_id');
</script>
<!-- End MailerLite Universal -->
```

> You can also get **MailerLite working with a button**, so that it opens as pop up:

```html
<a class="ml-onclick-form" href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="ml('show', 'some_id_here', true)">Click here to show form</a>

and use it with your components, for example
<form id="simple-newsletter-form" class="input-container" method="post" action="javascript:void(0);" onsubmit="ml('show', 'some_id_here', true); return false;">
    <input type="submit" value="Ready to Know?" class="ml-onclick-form" style="appearance: button; -webkit-appearance: button; cursor: pointer;">
</form>
```

You can also set **[automations](https://dashboard.mailerlite.com/automations) with MailerLite**: when a new sub -> then something.

You can use this, for example, to send a welcome email.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
  MailerLite can be [integrated also with](https://www.mailerlite.com/integrations) GSheets, Zapier, Stripe, email verification tools...

## Contact Forms

* Paid with KwesForms- https://formpress.org/pricing
    * https://kwesforms.com/pricing
    * You place [whatever front end UI](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/blog/dev-css/#flowbite) you like and they manage the forms back end

{{< details title="Using Google Forms 📌" closed="true" >}}

You just need to copy the html!

Generate a Google form and **add the iframe** wherever you want to place it:

```html
<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/some-id-of-your-form/viewform?embedded=true" width="640" height="854" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">Loading…</iframe>
```

{{< /details >}}

### Formbricks

You can use FormBricks for **launching surveys or contact forms.**

Go to the [FormBricks UI](https://formbricks.com/)

![alt text](/blog_img/entrepre/formbricks.png)

<!-- 
https://app.formbricks.com/environments/cm0vgwasu00061484bqmicsbm/surveys -->

> Can be **linked with**: GSheets also with [cal.com](https://app.cal.com/auth/login), and [more integrations like webhooks](https://app.formbricks.com/environments/cm0vgwasu00061484bqmicsbm/integrations)


If you link it with GSheets, you will have Formbricks Sheets Integration as an App in the [security tab of your gmail acc](https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup)

![Formbricks-GSheets](/blog_img/web/FormBricks_GSheets_App.png)


{{< details title="Using FormsBricks 📌" closed="true" >}}

```sh
yarn add @formbricks/js
```

Before the </head> add:

```html
<!-- START Formbricks Surveys -->
<script type="text/javascript">
  !function(){var t=document.createElement("script");t.type="text/javascript",t.async=!0,t.src="https://app.formbricks.com/js/formbricks.umd.cjs";var e=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];e.parentNode.insertBefore(t,e),setTimeout(function(){window.formbricks.init({environmentId: "someidforyou", apiHost: "https://app.formbricks.com"})},500)}();
  </script>
  <!-- END Formbricks Surveys -->
```

{{< /details >}}

This is how the admin panel looks:

![alt text](/blog_img/entrepre/formbricks-sample.png)


{{< callout type="warning" >}}
It seems that FormBricks Forms can just be embedded **and not opened as a hyperlink url**.
{{< /callout >}}

But, you can do **a cool trick**.

Setup FormBricks with no code, or with **code actions**

For more granular control, you can implement actions directly in your codebase:

1. Configure the Action: First, add the action via the Formbricks web interface to make it available for survey configuration. After that you can fire an action using formbricks.track()

2.  Track an Action: Use formbricks.track() to send an action event to Formbricks `formbricks.track("Action Name")`

Here is an example of how to fire an action when a user clicks a button:


```js
const handleClick = () => {
  formbricks.track("Button Clicked");
};

return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
```


> To make a button call the JS that makes FormBricks pop out.

### GoodSheet

* https://github.com/Luxapodular/GoodSheet

>  A tiny library that makes it easy to post and get data from a google sheet. 

{{< details title="Using GoodSheet.io 📌" closed="true" >}}

This can be combined with a Daisy UI CSS component, to get interesting functionality:
