## R Flexdashboards

Flexdashboards are a powerful tool for creating **dynamic, interactive dashboards within R**.

Developed by RStudio, they leverage the infrastructure of R Markdown to allow users to build **robust visual displays of information**.

Flexdashboards support a variety of visual outputs, including tables, data frames, plots, and even more advanced interactive visualizations using packages such as plotly and leaflet.

The strength of Flexdashboards lies in their **simplicity and ease of deployment**.

They use a **simple markdown syntax**, which makes it easy to layout and design the dashboard. They can be rendered as standalone HTML documents, which can be easily hosted on a variety of platforms, including GitHub Pages.

This makes Flexdashboards an excellent choice for static reporting and when sharing insights with an audience that does not require real-time interaction with the underlying data.

Flexdashboards are **static dashboards** - this means that they can be hosted like a **static web page** on Github pages, Gitlab pages...

This does not mean that you can't have interactivity in flexdashboards, since you can, for example include plotly graphs and include widgets to filter the data.


### Using Flexdashboards for the first time

You need the **R language** installed:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install r-base #this is ~150mb to get installed
sudo apt install pandoc #and this around ~200mb
```

See that **R is ready** with:

```sh
R --version
```

You will need to install the **flexdashboard package in R**:

```r
R #lets get into R CLI
install.packages("flexdashboard")

#remotes::install_github('rstudio/flexdashboard')
```

To author a flexdashboard you create an **R Markdown document with the flexdashboard::flex_dashboard output** format: its all about the`.Rmd`

You can do this from within RStudio using the New R Markdown dialog.

But you can also get started with vscode.

1. Example one - Just getting started:

```Rmd
---
title: "My First Flexdashboard"
output: flexdashboard::flex_dashboard
---

Column {data-width=650}
-------------------------------------

### Plot of Cars Data
```{r}
# Basic plot using the 'cars' dataset
plot(cars)
```

Now, we just need to run the script, so that the `html` gets renderd (**knitted** actually!)

```sh
Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('my_dashboard.Rmd')"
```

Now you can quickly see the result by **opening the html file**, or by:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000 #or 8001 if thats taken...
```

There yo go, the flexdashboard is posted at `http://localhost:8001/my_dashboard.html`

You can add these as part of static sites post (like this one) as iframe.

Just remember to include the file a `/public/my_dashboard.html` and then just call it:

```
<iframe 
  src="/my_dashboard.html" 
  width="100%" 
  height="800px" 
  frameborder="0">
  Your browser does not support iframes.
</iframe>
```



2. Let's create another Markdown file (I like to call it `index.Rmd`), that will be the one containing the **logic of our flexdashboard**:

```r
---
title: "Flex Dashboards"
author: JAT
output: 
  flexdashboard::flex_dashboard:
    orientation: column
    vertical_layout: fill
    source_code: embed
runtime: shiny
---
```

To test the changes that you are performing to the index.Rmd file, you will need to use the following commands in R:

```r
#wd<-dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path)
#setwd(wd)

rmarkdown::run("index.Rmd", shiny_args = list(port = 3838, host = "0.0.0.0"))
```
With this command, a new window will be displayed were you can interact with the dashboard locally.

When you will be done with the changes, you can **generate the HTML content** that will get displayed on the Github Page:

```r
rmarkdown::render_site("index.Rmd")
```

I Like to have those in a specific file **Flexdashboards.Rmd** to make easier the workflow.

After completion, you will see a new /docs folder containing the dashboard that will get **displayed at Github**.

Remember that you will need to install R dependnecies:


```sh
sudo apt-get install libgdal-dev libproj-dev libgeos-dev

R
#install.packages("leaflet")
install.packages("sf")      # Simple Features package for spatial data
#install.packages("leaflet", dependencies = TRUE)

install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rstudio/leaflet")
remotes::install_github("ropensci/plotly")

q()
```

You will see a `.Rhistory` file with the steps you made:

```sh
install.packages("terra")
install.packages("leaflet", dependencies = TRUE)
 install.packages("sf")      # Simple Features package for spatial data
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rstudio/leaflet")
q()
remotes::install_github("ropensci/plotly")
q()
```

### FlexDashboard with Github Pages

## How to Customize a Flexdashboard

There are great sources for ideas, I would start with:

* <https://pkgs.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/articles/layouts.html>
* <https://plotly.com/r/>
* <https://r-graph-gallery.com/>


## Flexdashboard Example - Open Data Analysis

You can explore **one example that I created**. That one is a litle bit more advanced.

They have separated tabs to showcase different **use-cases examples**:

* Map
* Interactive line chart
* 3D Scatter plot

* You can use it in the Github Page link: <https://jalcocert.github.io/R_is_Great/>
  * And check the code to get ideas at: <https://github.com/JAlcocerT/R_is_Great/tree/main/Flexdashboards>

## FAQ


### Other Ways to Present Data with R

#### How about Shiny?

**Shiny** is another product from RStudio that offers a framework for building interactive web applications entirely in R.

**Shiny is more flexible** than Flexdashboards and can create more complex and interactive applications. 

Shiny allows for real-time interaction, meaning that the user's inputs can directly affect the output, and the output is updated immediately.

This is ideal for creating dashboards where users may want to filter, slice, or manipulate the data to answer different questions.

However, **Shiny requires a running R session in the background**, which makes hosting a bit more complex compared to Flexdashboards.

Shiny apps can be hosted using Shiny Server or RStudio's hosting service, `ShinyApps.io`.
