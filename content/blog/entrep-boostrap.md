### Entrepre-AI

Last year I was outputting a bunch of ideas to do with some kind of all in one Aissistant at [this post](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/ai-useful-yet-simple/#for-entrepreneurs).

One section was made for entrepreneurs: *some tips and tricks about neuromarketing etc*

> Havent you ever fell into one of those CTA's?

And via the [multi-chat project](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Streamlit-MultiChat), I collected some general idea:

Time to put something together, for when you are about to build in public, create a waiting list...

* CTA's
    * Quieres el premium? No, correre el riesgo!
    * You don’t have to miss out
    * They all laugh when…
    * What sounds better than privacy?
    * Is your Business performing at 100%? Here is the best/easiest way to find out
        * Measure, Check, Act
    * Blinded pa lazyness?
    * A friend told me that this will fail as people on ig has really nothing to say
      * Lets proove him wrong

* Interesting catchy sentences:
  * Pollo hecho en serio y no en serie
  * Hay una casa para cada persona, hay una app para todas las casas.
  * Lets sea
  * We ve bean waiting for you (coffee)
  * Make IT happen
  * Fotografiamos historias de amor. 
    * La historia la escribís vosotros; nosotros la contaremos con imágenes.
