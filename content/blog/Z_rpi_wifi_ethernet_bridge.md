## Raspberry Pi: Wifi Bridge

Inspired by the awsome work of **[William Halley in his blog](https://www.willhaley.com/blog/raspberry-pi-wifi-ethernet-bridge/)**, where I was able to follow succesfully and *to share Wifi through Ethernet on a separated subnet* [with a Raspberry Pi 4 2GB](https://jalcocert.github.io/RPi/posts/rpi-wifi-ethernet-bridge/)

> Let's learn a little bit about **Networking by doing!**


{{< details title="Option 1 - Wifi to Ethernet with Separated subnet ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}


The script that is provided is this one (again, credits to William):

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -e

[ $EUID -ne 0 ] && echo "run as root" >&2 && exit 1

apt update && \
  DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt install -y \
    dnsmasq netfilter-persistent iptables-persistent

# Create and persist iptables rule.
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o wlan0 -j MASQUERADE
netfilter-persistent save

# Enable ipv4 forwarding.
sed -i'' s/#net.ipv4.ip_forward=1/net.ipv4.ip_forward=1/ /etc/sysctl.conf

# The Ethernet adapter will use a static IP of 10.1.1.1 on this new subnet.
cat <<'EOF' >/etc/network/interfaces.d/eth0
auto eth0
allow-hotplug eth0
iface eth0 inet static
  address 10.1.1.1
  netmask 255.255.255.0
  gateway 10.1.1.1
EOF

# Create a dnsmasq DHCP config at /etc/dnsmasq.d/bridge.conf. The Raspberry Pi
# will act as a DHCP server to the client connected over ethernet.
cat <<'EOF' >/etc/dnsmasq.d/bridge.conf
interface=eth0
bind-interfaces
server=8.8.8.8
domain-needed
bogus-priv
dhcp-range=10.1.1.2,10.1.1.254,12h
EOF

systemctl mask networking.service
```

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Remember**, the names of wlan0 and eth0 used, can be different in other devices, check it with:
{{< /callout >}}

```sh
ifconfig
```

{{< /details >}}


The end result is that **the Raspberry Pi will act as a bridge between the WiFi connection and the Ethernet connection**, providing Internet access to devices connected via Ethernet- to the RPi.


## Raspberry Pi Bridge: Wifi to Ethernet (With wireguard)

That was really great and I was really impressed and happy that it worked perfectly the first time I tried.

Then, I wondered...*if the Raspberry Pi would be having a VPN connection, could we provide to the ethernet connected device that same connection?*

I decided to try with **Wireguard** (you will need a working VPN server that generates Wireguard config) and surprisingly **it worked with some modification**:

{{< details title="Pre-Requisite - We need to have wireguard installed: ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}


```sh
sudo apt install wireguard
cp /home/Downloads/your_vpn_wireguard_configuration.conf /etc/wireguard #download the wireguard config: account-wireguard configuration
sudo wg-quick your_vpn_wireguard_configuration #the name of the .conf file that you have downloaded
```

This will make your wireguard client to be connected to the server.

Do you want to [check your public IP?](#is-the-vpn-working)

```sh
curl -sS https://ipinfo.io/json #the command to use
```

And if you need, to disconnect from Wireguard, just:

```sh
wg-quick down <name>
sudo wg-quick down your_vpn_wireguard_configuration
#sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf #to check/adapt DNS name (optional)
#sudo reboot (optional)
```

{{< /details >}}
 
{{% steps %}}

### Use this command to check which network interface your wireguard VPN has:

```sh
ifconfig
```

### This will be our new **bridge_wireguard.sh** script to route the WIFI to ethernet and provide VPN connection at the same time:

```sh
sudo nano bridge_wireguard.sh
```

apt update && \

# Create and persist iptables rule.
# Here's the change: we're using the WireGuard interface (your_vpn_wireguard_netw_interface) instead of the WiFi interface (wlan0).
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o your_vpn_wireguard_netw_interface -j MASQUERADE
netfilter-persistent save

# Enable ipv4 forwarding.
sed -i'' s/#net.ipv4.ip_forward=1/net.ipv4.ip_forward=1/ /etc/sysctl.conf

```sh
sudo bash bridge_wireguard.sh
sudo reboot
```

{{< callout type="info" >}}
with this version, you can route the traffic through any Wireguard Traffic (from your [custom VPS](#vps-for-the-experiment) or a provider like Mullvad, ProtonVPN,...)
