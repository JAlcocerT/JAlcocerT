For some time already, I have been improving my guide on Linux.

I like how simple it is to format and setup Linux again, but I found that we can do exactly the samer thing in windows.

The trick is called [Chocolatey](https://jalcocert.github.io/Linux/docs/#how-to-start-my-linux-journey)

And here is how you can use it too:

Open powershell **as admin**
```ps
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
choco --version
```


```ps
choco install podman-desktop
```

Run podman compose up (podman CLI v4.7.0+) or docker-compose in a directory with a compose.yaml. Podman Desktop will automatically detect the Compose deployment and show it in the container list.'

```ps
podman compose up
```

You will need windows subsystem for linux (WSL)

```ps
wsl --install
wsl --version
```

```ps
podman machine init
```

I have this gist with my favourite commands - https://gist.github.com/JAlcocerT/76f22ddf886277ef2653f82898c634d8
