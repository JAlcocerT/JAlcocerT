For some time already, I have been improving my guide on Linux.

I like how simple it is to format and setup Linux again, but I found that we can do exactly the samer thing in windows.

The trick is called [Chocolatey](https://jalcocert.github.io/Linux/docs/#how-to-start-my-linux-journey)

And here is how you can use it too:

```ps
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))


```

I have this gist with my favourite commands - https://gist.github.com/JAlcocerT/76f22ddf886277ef2653f82898c634d8
