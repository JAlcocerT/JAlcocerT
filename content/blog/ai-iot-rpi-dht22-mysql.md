It all started with the RPi projects I published here about a [Pi working together with a DHT22 sensor.](https://jalcocert.github.io/RPi/posts/rpi-iot-dht11-influxdb/).

Then, I learnt how to use [LangChain to chat with a DB](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/how-to-chat-with-your-data/#chat-with-a-db-with-langchain).

The next step is pretty much clear.

To join both worlds.

And be able to **chat with a DB where the DHT22 sensor data (temp and humidity) is being stored**.
