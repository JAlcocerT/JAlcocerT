### Raspberry Pi

#### Python x Elastic Search

Python can push data to Elasticsearch. 

Elasticsearch is a popular open-source search and analytics engine that is often used for storing, searching, and analyzing large volumes of data in real-time. 

It is designed to handle various types of structured and unstructured data, making it useful for a wide range of applications, including log and event data analysis, full-text search, and more.

To push data to Elasticsearch from Python, you can use the official Elasticsearch Python client library, which provides a convenient way to interact with Elasticsearch from your Python code.

#### Py x TimeScaleDB


I made this small projec tiwh the **DS18B20 sensor**

> But it can work also with the DHT11

The DS18B20 can detect: -55 to 125 Celsius

* Connection:
  * Black cable - gnd
  * Red - 3.3 to 5v
  * Yellow - data --> to pin 7
  * It needs a resistor. A 4.7K Ohm Resistor (Colour Code: Yellow Purple Red Gold)
    * or 4.7k/10k resistor between data and 3.3v


* These videos were of great help to me:

  * <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDdJ6stXQi0&t=10s>
  * <https://bigl.es/ds18b20-temperature-sensor-with-python-raspberry-pi/>



**RPi 1-wire must be enabled!!!**

connect the wiring and go to /sys/bus/w1/devices and find the folder with the serial number, then select the w1_slave file

the file should contain a YES in the first line.

The video from ReefSpy helped me a lot with the initial setup :<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76CD_waImoA>

And also to get the general idea of the Python code that can be used.

Execute it with: `python3 dsb-read.py`


I also included a Dockerfile, so you can `docker build -t dsb_to_timescale`

There is a Stack ready to run the Python script and push the data to timescale - all in Docker containers:

I have tagged and uploaded it to my DockerHub so that it works with timescaleDB:

```sh
docker tag dsb_to_timescale docker.io/fossengineer/iot:dsb_sensor_to_timescale

docker push docker.io/fossengineer/iot:dsb_sensor_to_timescale
```

> Check it at https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/fossengineer/iot/general


```sh
docker run -it --rm --network=dsbtimescale_dsb_network postgres psql -h timescaledb_dsb_container -U myuser -d mydb --username=myuser

\l

psql -U myuser -d mydb

\d
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM ds18b20_sensor;
SELECT MAX(temperature) FROM ds18b20_sensor;
SELECT * FROM ds18b20_sensor ORDER BY time DESC LIMIT 1;
```
