**TL;DR** 

Lately, I have been playing with Gitea's API.

It made me think how to combine Gitea as a source for SSG for website generation.

While the posts skeletons could be passed into a n8n workflow, with some openai LLMs / codex / whatever to shape them as per some input data.

Scrapping from a website, data formatting for real estate or events...you name it.
