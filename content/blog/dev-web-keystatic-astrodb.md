On this post I will be covering:

1. Astro

2. Embedded Analytics into Astro

3. Animations

### Astro DataNova Theme

* https://github.com/mearashadowfax/DataNova
    * https://github.com/JAlcocerT/DataNova

> **MIT** | Open-source Astro website template with TailwindCSS, Keystatic CMS, and Astro DB support.

Could not resist to [fork it](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/DataNova).

And used it with cloudflare pages configured at [private this repo](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/jalcocertech)

And to get familiar with: https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/astro-db/

```sh
git clone https://github.com/JAlcocerT/DataNova
#rm -r .git

rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit for your site"
#assuming you have https://github.com/JAlcocerT/jalcocertech

git remote add origin https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/jalcocertech.git
#git remote add origin https://github.com/JAlcocerT/jalcocertech.git
```

## FAQ

### More Astro Themes

You always get surprised with astro themes:

* https://github.com/mearashadowfax/OpenStove

>  A free, community-driven platform for sharing and discovering recipes. No ads, just good food! 

* https://github.com/wpinfusion/astro-hyperdrive

> An Astro template designed for **Automotive dealerships**. For the ones who like [cars](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/buying-car-data-analytics/)!

#### Astro Components I discovered

As always, trying some new astro theme makes you discover some very cool components.

## Outro

### Embedded Analytics

Lately I have been tinkering with Streamlit and PyGWalker on [this post](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/ai-bi-tools/#pygwalker).


But I was also surprised on how much can be achieved via Plotly, ChartJS or ApexChartsJS.

In fact, to render interesting interactive charts into your SSG powered websites, like astro its just a matter of having the *declarative knowledge* that you can actuualy do it.

Just think of a interesting visual you want to have, tell to windsurf to vibe code your astro component that renders it and simply import it into your post.

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/ai-bi-tools/#pygwalker" title="AI Bi Tools Post" image="/blog_img/apps/streamlit/st_pygwalker_map.png" subtitle="Writting about Streamlit PoC with PyGWalker" >}}

  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Streamlit_PoC" title="Streamlit PoC" image="/blog_img/apps/gh-jalcocert.svg" subtitle="Source Code on Github. Streamlit Rendering Plotly, MermaidJS, QR, ChartJS, ApexCharts, PyGWalker with OSM geolocation data..." >}}

How can these chart actually look like?

![ApexChartsJS and Astro SSG Theme ](/blog_img/web/astro/astro-apexchartsjs-component.png)

Again: *and these are interactive charts!*

Another option is to embedd the *knitted html* of a R FlexDashboard to your SSG powered websites:

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/r-dashboard-shinyapps/" title="Retirement Facts [Post]" image="/blog_img/data-experiments/Inflation_Mild.JPG" subtitle="Life savings and inflation in a R Shiny App." >}}
  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/R_is_Great/tree/main/ShinyApps" title="Retirement Facts" image="/blog_img/apps/gh-jalcocert.svg" subtitle="Life savings and inflation in a R Shiny App." >}}
{{< /cards >}}

But I find the Astro + Graph base component a much cooler (and simpler) approach.

### Animations

If what you want is to create a simple a quick .mp4, then **matplotlib + Python** should be your go to.

You can do very smooth animations, with gradient background colors, 

* For matching image background colors, this was usefulhttps://imagecolorpicker.com/

They should not be something new to you If you have explored Gabe's mechanism project and my post about it.

### Wordpress and NRR

For **WordPress.com (the hosted service)**, I would guestimate their **Net Revenue Retention (NRR) to be in the range of 90% to 110%+**.

Here's why:

* **Subscription Model:** WordPress.com operates on a recurring subscription model (freemium with paid plans for features, storage, and support). Recurring revenue businesses typically have an NRR as a key performance indicator.
* **High Switching Costs:** Once a website is built and established on a platform like WordPress.com, migrating it to another provider can be complex and time-consuming. This "stickiness" inherently contributes to higher retention.
* **Upselling and Cross-selling Opportunities:**
    * Users often start with basic plans and upgrade as their needs grow (e.g., needing more storage, custom domain, e-commerce features with WooCommerce, advanced SEO tools, premium themes/plugins).
    * Automattic has also acquired other services (like WooCommerce, Jetpack, Tumblr) which can lead to cross-selling opportunities to their existing WordPress.com customer base.
* **Brand Recognition and Ecosystem:** WordPress.com benefits from the massive brand recognition of WordPress itself and a vast ecosystem of themes and plugins, which adds value and encourages continued use.
* **Customer Support and Managed Services:** For many users, the convenience of managed hosting and readily available support is a key factor in staying with WordPress.com rather than self-hosting.

An NRR of **over 100%** (e.g., 105% or 110%) would indicate that WordPress.com is not only retaining most of its customers but also successfully increasing revenue from its existing customer base through upgrades and additional service purchases. Given their scale and the continuous development of their offerings, achieving NRR over 100% is certainly plausible.

Without direct financial disclosures from Automattic, this remains an informed approximation.

### How to setup StrapiCMS?

If you are looking from CMS, you can have a look to [this post](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/cms-for-static-websites), where I [setup KeystaticCMS](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/cms-for-static-websites/#keystatic-cms)
