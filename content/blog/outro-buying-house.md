If you are getting a credit...

Before anything, understand how [French Amortization](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/python-real-estate-mortage-calculator/) works.

And maybe have a look to the properties around with some [RE AIgent](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/streamlit-is-cool/).


## Property Costs Analytics

A **gantt chart** is worth a zillion words:

## Conclusions

This project started as a test to see the costs of owning a house.

I got to know how quickly furniture costs can escalate: whats x1 can be x4

Id say you have to stay open for ideas: not only IKEA, but maybe sklum or others...

And in the meantime I thought on how to estimate the **painting cost, given a house plan**.

Lets say that it cost **~65eur afor 15kg of paint.**

With that one, you can paint ~100m2.

How to estimate the wall size in your flat based on the floor plan and the total area.

**Understanding the Challenge**

We only have the area of each room, not the exact dimensions (length and width). To estimate wall length, we'll need to make some assumptions about the shape of the rooms.

**Assumptions**

1. **Rectangular Rooms:** We'll assume all rooms are roughly rectangular. This is a common assumption for floor plans.
2. **Simplified Shapes:** We'll treat the overall shape of the flat as a rectangle for easier calculation.

**Estimation Process**

1. **Calculate the Perimeter of Each Room:**
   * For a rectangle, the perimeter is 2 * (length + width).
   * Since we only have the area, we'll need to estimate the length and width. We can do this by assuming the rooms are close to square for an initial estimate.
   * For example, for a room with 26.4 m¬≤, assuming it's square, each side would be approximately ‚àö26.4 ‚âà 5.14 meters. The perimeter would be roughly 4 * 5.14 ‚âà 20.56 meters.

2. **Sum the Perimeters:** Add up the estimated perimeters of all the rooms.

3. **Adjust for Shared Walls:** The sum of the perimeters will overcount the walls because it counts each wall twice (once for each room it borders). We need to subtract the length of the shared walls.

4. **Estimate Shared Walls:**
   * Look at the floor plan and estimate which walls are shared between rooms.
   * Make reasonable estimations of the length of these shared walls.

5. **Subtract Shared Wall Lengths:** Subtract the estimated total length of shared walls from the sum of the perimeters.

**Let's Do the Calculations (Rough Estimate)**

1. **Room Perimeters (Approximations):**
   * Pok√≥j dzienny (26.4 m¬≤): ‚âà 20.56 m
   * Pok√≥j (9.2 m¬≤): ‚âà 12.12 m
   * ≈Åazienka (4.4 m¬≤): ‚âà 8.37 m
   * Kuchnia (6.4 m¬≤): ‚âà 10.12 m
   * Przedpok√≥j (7 m¬≤): ‚âà 10.58 m
   * Loggia (2.6 m¬≤): ‚âà 6.44 m

2. **Sum of Perimeters:** 20.56 + 12.12 + 8.37 + 10.12 + 10.58 + 6.44 ‚âà 68.19 meters

3. **Estimate Shared Walls:**
   * Looking at the floor plan, there are several shared walls. We need to estimate their lengths.
   * This is where it gets tricky without exact dimensions. Let's make a rough guess that the total length of shared walls is about 20 meters (this is just an estimation).

4. **Subtract Shared Walls:** 68.19 - 20 ‚âà 48.19 meters

**Important Note:** This is a rough estimation. Without precise dimensions, it's impossible to get an exact wall length.

**Refining the Estimate**

To improve the estimate, you would need:

* **More Detailed Dimensions:** If you have the length and width of each room, the calculations would be much more accurate.
* **Wall Thickness:** We haven't accounted for wall thickness, which would add to the overall length.

Be knowing the area (55m2 for example), you already know the **ceiling paint**.

Or you can just estimate the internal walls with sqrt(area=55) = 7.7

So that would be 15m, times the height of the walls (say 2m), which would be 30 m2.

But you are missing all internal walls which make the rooms, say thats 100% more.

{{< /details >}}

> First estimation ~ 55+30*2 = 115m2, which for **2 layers** would be ~30kg

The world of home paints can be a bit overwhelming with different types and terminologies. Let's break down some common categories and their pros and cons:

### Synthetic Paints

"Synthetic" is a broad term that essentially means the paint is made from artificially created materials, often derived from petrochemicals. Many modern paints fall under this category. Within synthetic paints, you'll find various binders (the substance that holds the pigment together and adheres to the surface), each with its own characteristics.

**Pros:**

* **Durability and Resistance:** Generally offer good resistance to wear, tear, moisture, and UV light, leading to a longer-lasting finish.
* **Wide Range of Colors:** Synthetic pigments often provide more vibrant and long-lasting colors.
* **Good Coverage:** Many synthetic paints offer excellent opacity, requiring fewer coats.
* **Versatility:** Can be formulated for various surfaces like wood, metal, and walls.
* **Affordability:** Often more cost-effective than natural paints.

**Cons:**

* **VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds):** Can release higher levels of VOCs, which can negatively impact indoor air quality and pose health risks. Water-based synthetic paints generally have lower VOCs than solvent-based ones.
* **Environmental Impact:** Production often relies on non-renewable resources and energy-intensive processes.
* **Breathability:** May not allow walls to "breathe" as much as some natural paints, potentially trapping moisture.
* **Strong Odor:** Solvent-based synthetic paints can have a strong and lingering odor.
* **Cleaning:** Often require solvents like mineral spirits for cleaning brushes and spills.

### Acrylic Paints

Acrylic paints are a type of synthetic paint where the binder is an acrylic resin. They are water-based.

**Pros:**

* **Quick Drying Time:** Dries relatively fast, allowing for quicker recoating.
* **Water-Based:** Easier to clean up with soap and water while wet. Lower odor and VOCs compared to oil-based paints.
* **Good Adhesion:** Adheres well to various surfaces, including walls, ceilings, furniture, and even some exterior applications.
* **Durability and Flexibility:** Once dry, they are water-resistant and flexible, making them less prone to cracking and peeling, especially on surfaces that might expand or contract.
* **Color Retention:** Colors tend to remain vibrant after drying.
* **Versatility:** Can be mixed with various mediums to achieve different textures and effects.
* **Affordability:** Generally more budget-friendly than oil-based paints.

**Cons:**

* **Fast Drying Can Be a Drawback:** Requires working quickly to avoid brush strokes and issues with blending.
* **Color Shift:** May slightly darken as it dries, which can be a consideration for color matching.
* **Can Be Difficult to Remove When Dry:** Once acrylic paint dries, it becomes water-resistant and can be challenging to remove from surfaces and brushes.
* **May Require Priming:** Some surfaces may need a primer for optimal adhesion.

### Latex Paints

"Latex" paint is a bit of a misnomer because most modern latex paints do not actually contain natural rubber latex. They are also water-based and use synthetic polymers like acrylic, vinyl acrylic, or a combination as binders. For practical purposes in the home painting context, **latex paints are often considered a subset of acrylic or vinyl-acrylic water-based paints.**

**Pros:**

* **Easy Application:** Generally easy to apply with brushes, rollers, or sprayers.
* **Quick Drying Time:** Dries relatively quickly.
* **Water-Based:** Easy cleanup with soap and water. Low odor and VOCs compared to oil-based paints.
* **Good Flexibility:** Offers good flexibility, resisting cracking and peeling, especially on walls and ceilings.
* **Breathability:** Allows better breathability compared to some oil-based or high-gloss paints.
* **Wide Availability and Affordability:** Widely available and generally more cost-effective than oil-based or some specialized acrylic paints.
* **Good for Interior Walls and Ceilings:** Well-suited for most interior painting projects.
* **Non-Yellowing:** Resists yellowing over time, especially in areas not exposed to direct sunlight.

**Cons:**

* **Can Show Brush Strokes:** Some formulations or application techniques may result in visible brush strokes.
* **Less Durable Than Some Acrylics:** May not be as durable or scrub-resistant as high-quality 100% acrylic paints, especially in high-traffic areas or bathrooms.
* **Not Ideal for All Surfaces:** May not adhere well to glossy surfaces or metal without proper priming.
* **Can Swell Wood Grain:** Water-based nature can cause wood grain to swell if not properly sealed.
* **Less Suitable for Exterior:** Generally not as durable as exterior-grade acrylic paints for outdoor use due to less resistance to weather elements.

{{< /details >}}


**In summary:**

* For most **interior walls and ceilings**, **latex (water-based acrylic or vinyl-acrylic)** paints are a popular and practical choice due to their ease of use, cleanup, low odor, and affordability.
* For **high-moisture areas like bathrooms and kitchens**, or for **exterior projects**, **100% acrylic paints** are often preferred for their better durability, adhesion, and resistance to moisture and mildew.
* **Synthetic paints** encompass a broad category, and understanding the specific binder (like acrylic) will give you a better idea of the paint's properties. Oil-based synthetic paints are less common for general home use now due to VOCs and cleanup requirements but still have specific applications (e.g., durable finishes on trim or metal).

When choosing paint, consider the surface you're painting, the desired finish (matte, satin, semi-gloss, gloss), the level of durability needed, and your preference regarding VOCs and ease of cleanup.

Some people are building their custom and modular houses.

And there are others, which are shipping their concepts to others.

> Delivering a home...like a container? With all the features agreed upon? Interesting!


I can imagine DIY home owners have a sense of priorities like any other.

Like...should you get those **adidas GN3530** you like?

Or are you fine with the ones you were so excited to buy few months ago?
