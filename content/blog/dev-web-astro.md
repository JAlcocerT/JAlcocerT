To use **ASTRO**, you just need **2 things**: NPM and NodeJS.

* https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
* https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager

> Why ASTRO? It builds sites **cool Websites**, taking **components** from here & there

{{< details title="Setup Node and NPM - x86/ARM64/ARM32 ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

#install NodeJS https://deb.nodesource.com/
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
#FOR MAC #brew install node

# Verify installation
node -v   # Should show Node.js version - 20.18.1
npm -v    # Should show npm version - 10.8.2
```
{{< /details >}}

Now you can spin a server and make **ASTRO [Remote Development](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/blog/dev-in-docker)** in it.


---

If you want to be sure that **ASTRO works...**

1. See that you got the desired versions installed

```sh
node -v   # Should show Node.js version - 20.18.1
npm -v    # Should show npm version - 10.8.2
```

2. Clone **this Website** Repository and try to **run it locally**:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/JAlcocerT/web3 && cd ./web3

npm install
#npm run dev
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4321 #http://192.168.1.11:4321/
```

3. [Optional] - Use [Astro within a Container](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/blog/dev-in-docker/#node)

---

```sh
ifconfig
#ifconfig eth0 | grep -A 10 "<global>" #check mac, and transfered packages
ifconfig eth0 | grep "inet " | awk '{ print $2 }' #if ETH Connected - SEE THE LOCAL IP
#ifconfig tailscale0 | grep "inet " | awk '{ print $2 }' #for Tailscale
```

You can use [Astro with Github Pages + GH Actions](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/web3/actions)
{{< /callout >}}

See **Interesting Astro Themes**.

Like AstroWind, *which uses [Tailwind CSS](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/blog/dev-css/#competitors-to-tailwind-css)*

At `astro.config.mjs` you will need:

```js
import robots from "astro-robots";
import sitemap from "@astrojs/sitemap";

//....

integrations:[sitemap(), robots()],
```

The `og-image.jpg` image (or whatever you name your image file) should be placed directly in the `./public` directory at the root of your Astro project.

**Why the public directory?**

Static Assets: The public directory in Astro (and many other web frameworks) is specifically designated for static assets. 

These are files that are served directly to the browser without any processing by Astro.

Examples include:

Images (like your Open Graph image)
Favicons
robots.txt
sitemap.xml
Fonts

Direct URL Access: Files in the public directory are accessible directly via their path relative to the root of your website.

So, if you place og-image.jpg in public, it will be accessible at yourdomain.com/og-image.jpg (or localhost:3000/og-image.jpg during development).

This is precisely what we want for an Open Graph image, as social media platforms need to be able to fetch it directly.

Build process: during the build process, files located on the public folder are copied to the dist folder (output folder).

## FAQ

### Astro for MAC Setup

To install Homebrew on Ubuntu, follow these steps:

**1. Install Prerequisites:**

Before installing Homebrew, you need to ensure that some essential packages are installed on your Ubuntu system. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential curl file git
```

This command will:

* `sudo apt update`: Update the package lists.
* `sudo apt install build-essential`: Install essential tools for compiling software.
* `sudo apt install curl`: Install `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data with URLs.
* `sudo apt install file`: Install the `file` command, which determines file types.
* `sudo apt install git`: Install `git`, a distributed version control system (Homebrew uses Git to manage its package repositories).

**2. Download and Execute the Homebrew Installation Script:**

The official Homebrew website provides an installation script that you can download and execute. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

This command will:

* `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh`: Download the Homebrew installation script from GitHub.
    * `-f`: Fail silently (no output on errors).
    * `-s`: Silent mode (don't show progress bar or errors unless they occur).
    * `-S`: Show errors if they occur.
    * `-L`: Follow redirects.
* `/bin/bash -c "..."`: Execute the downloaded script using Bash.

The script will explain what it will do and then prompt you to confirm the installation by pressing Enter.

**3. Follow the On-Screen Instructions:**

The installation script will guide you through the process. It will likely ask for your password (as it might need to create directories) and will inform you about the installation location (usually under `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew`).

**4. Add Homebrew to Your System's PATH:**

After the installation is complete, the script will usually provide you with commands to add Homebrew to your system's PATH environment variable. This allows you to run the `brew` command from any directory in your terminal. The commands will typically look something like this (the exact path might vary slightly):

```bash
echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.bashrc
eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

* The first command adds the necessary line to your `~/.bashrc` file, so the PATH is updated every time you start a new terminal session.
* The second command updates the PATH in your current terminal session.

If you are using a different shell (like Zsh), you might need to add the lines to `~/.zshrc` instead of `~/.bashrc`.

**5. Verify the Installation:**

To confirm that Homebrew has been installed correctly, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
brew --version
```

This should display the installed version of Homebrew.

You can also run the `brew doctor` command to check for any potential issues with your Homebrew installation:

```bash
brew doctor
```

Follow any instructions provided by `brew doctor` to resolve any warnings or errors.

Now you should have Homebrew successfully installed on your Ubuntu system and can start using the `brew` command to install packages.

**Then, you just install node and npm with brew**

```sh
brew install node
node -v
npm -v
```
