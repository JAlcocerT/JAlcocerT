I Got a new phone recently.

It promises years of updates. 

Will it be better value for money than the Xiami PocoPhone F1 I got in 2019 for ~325$?

With the poco, I had available:

{{< details title="What about LineageOS ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

LineageOS is a free and open-source operating system for smartphones and tablets, based on the Android mobile platform. It is the successor to CyanogenMod, from which it was forked in December 2016. 

**What is LineageOS?**

* **Custom Android:** LineageOS is essentially a modified version of Android. It takes the open-source code of Android and adds its own customizations and features.
* **Community-driven:** It's developed and maintained by a community of developers, rather than a single company like Google or a phone manufacturer.
* **Focus on customization:** LineageOS is known for its focus on user customization and privacy. It often includes features that aren't found in the stock version of Android.
* **Extending device lifespan:** It can breathe new life into older devices that may no longer receive updates from their manufacturers.

**Is it Google compatible?**

* **Mostly yes:** LineageOS itself doesn't come with Google apps (like the Play Store, Gmail, etc.) pre-installed. This is because these apps are proprietary to Google.
* **You can add Google services:** However, you can usually install Google services and apps separately if you want to use them. This involves a process called "flashing" a Google package (often called "GApps") onto your device.
* **Some limitations:** While most Google apps work fine, there might be occasional compatibility issues with some Google services.

**What's the difference with Android?**

* **Stock Android vs. LineageOS:** Think of stock Android as the "vanilla" version of Android, while LineageOS is a customized version with added features and tweaks.
* **Key differences:**
    * **Customization:** LineageOS typically offers more customization options than stock Android, allowing you to tweak things like themes, icons, and system behavior.
    * **Features:** It may include features not found in stock Android, such as enhanced privacy settings, advanced theming options, and performance improvements.
    * **Updates:** LineageOS often provides updates for devices that are no longer supported by their manufacturers, extending the lifespan of your device.
    * **Bloatware:** LineageOS generally doesn't include the bloatware (pre-installed, unnecessary apps) that often comes with stock Android from manufacturers.
    * **Google apps:** As mentioned earlier, Google apps are not pre-installed on LineageOS, giving you more control over what apps you have on your device.

**In summary:** LineageOS is a popular choice for Android enthusiasts who want more control over their devices, more customization options, and a potentially longer lifespan for their older devices.
