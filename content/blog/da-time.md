## Understanding your Productivity Peak

Finding your prodictivity rhythm.

### Establish Boundaries

More can be less in terms of productivity if you dont have the actual time to complete to the end the tasks or assigments.

### Scheduled To-Do

Replacing the to-do list for a *scheduled To-Do*.

* The timeframe in which the task can be actionable is key.

## Avoid Multi-Tasking

We can do more than one thing at a time. But our brains can't focus in more than one thing at a time.

* Understand **the switching cost** - when changing tasks, it will require time to get the background variables in place before actually making progress in the task
* **Background tasking** - your focus is somewhere else
* Overcome the **opportunity addiction** 
    - One thing at a time
    - Get better at saying NO (to you and to others)

## During Meetings

Focus in actions to be taken and its dependencies.

## Remove Time Liabilities

These are the things that use time because they are out of day or under-performing.

## Overcome the *Analysis Paralysis*

When presented with **too many options**, you might be consfused and not sure how to move forward.

Stop for a moment and break the concepts in steps.

Look for the first minute activity that would make you be one step closer to completion.

## Prioritize Work

* Is this actually needed? 
    - Keep in mind the value that the customer perceives out of this task <!-- Lean, VSM -->
    - Try Reverse Pilot - Scale the activity back / eliminate a task and check if it makes a difference 
* Can it be delegated?
* Can it be automatized?
* Am I the bottleneck? - Aka, stopping others to be productive?
