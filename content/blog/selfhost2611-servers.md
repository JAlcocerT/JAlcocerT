**Tl;DR**

Five (+) years with selfhosting...

**Intro**

Put the time and the digital world is yours.

All those backups, monitoring, IoT...

Yes, all that.


## HomeLab x OSS

This has been my route towards OSS.

Some are still paiting OSS as mad max.

With chaos and things breaking all the time.

The truth is that I have had such situations, but after the transition phase you arrive to stability.

I coudldnt be happier with these daily drivers:

```sh
#wget -P ~/Applications https://github.com/imputnet/helium-linux/releases/download/0.5.7.1/Helium-0.5.7.1-x86_64.AppImage
flatpak install flathub app.zen_browser.zen -y
```

### DNS

#### SSL x https


### BackUps

#### Your Videos and Media

Just telling, if you like going karting and recording with an action cam:


{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/docs/coolresources/video/" title="Video | Docs ↗" icon="book-open" >}}
  {{< card link="https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/docs/coolresources/race/" title="Racing | Docs ↗" icon="book-open" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

You will probably enjoy these for watching and sharing with your friends:

In the end P2P is a pretty amazing distributed backup tool!

## Conclusions

Selfhosting and self-learning about servers have opened my mind by brute force these years.
