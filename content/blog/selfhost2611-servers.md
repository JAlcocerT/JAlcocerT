#### Your Videos and Media

Just telling, if you like going karting and recording with an action cam:


{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/docs/coolresources/video/" title="Video | Docs ↗" icon="book-open" >}}
  {{< card link="https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/docs/coolresources/race/" title="Racing | Docs ↗" icon="book-open" >}}

In the end P2P is a pretty amazing distributed backup tool!
