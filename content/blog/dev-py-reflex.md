Reflex is another way to create WebApps with Python.

I think it should be in between Streamlit and Flask in terms of UI and development complexity:

* https://reflex.dev/templates/dashboard/
* https://github.com/reflex-dev/reflex/releases
* https://reflex.dev/templates/
    * https://github.com/reflex-dev/templates

Why not just building something simple to try out?

What I want to use it for?

How about enhancing these streamlit projects?

{{< /cards >}}

Enhancing in a way...that they are also good looking and providing UI/UX for mobile users?

Lets have a look.

{{< details title="Compile Python on a Pi üìå" closed="true" >}}

```sh
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.5/Python-3.11.5.tgz
tar xzf Python-3.11.5.tgz

cd Python-3.11.5
./configure --enable-optimizations --with-ensurepip --prefix=/usr/local/python311  # Adjust path and version if needed


#compile
make -j$(nproc)  # Use all available cores for faster compilation
#install
sudo make altinstall  #  "altinstall" is IMPORTANT!
```

```sh
nano ~/.bashrc  # Or nano ~/.zshrc if you use zsh

export PATH="/usr/local/python311/bin:$PATH"
source ~/.bashrc  # Or source ~/.zshrc
```

```sh
python3.11 --version  # Or python3.x if you installed a different minor version
pip3.11 --version
pip3.11 install --upgrade virtualenv --user
```


{{< /details >}}

```sh
sudo apt-get install python3-virtualenv

python3.11 -m venv my_env  # Creates a virtual environment named my_env
source my_env/bin/activate  # Activates the environment
```


### Reflex 101

```sh
pip install reflex
reflex init
reflex run #this compiles and execute the sample app
```

The **front end UI** will be at `localhost:3000`


{{< callout type="info" >}}
You will also need `localhost:8000` for the BE (which can conflict with Portainer!) 
{{< /callout >}}



```bash
sudo docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 9000:9000 --name=portainer --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer-ce
```

With reflex, we can do full stack web apps with just Python, for example [this chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuNaI__4xiU&list=PLEsfXFp6DpzRDEA6ElMF_NuLu9cvoK49v&index=13)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/codingforentrepreneurs/reflex-gpt #thanks to codingforentrepreneurs once again!
```

These are the main files and **structure of a Reflex Project**:

{{< filetree/container >}}
  {{< filetree/folder name="content" >}}
    {{< filetree/file name="_index.md" >}}
    {{< filetree/folder name="docs" state="closed" >}}

If you inspect, this is how the reflex `main.py` looks:

```py
"""Welcome to Reflex! This file outlines the steps to create a basic app.""" #Shown as title

import reflex as rx

from rxconfig import config


class State(rx.State):
    """The app state."""

    ...


def index() -> rx.Component:
    # Welcome Page (Index)
    return rx.container(
        rx.color_mode.button(position="top-right"),
        rx.vstack(
            rx.heading("Welcome to Reflex!", size="9"),
            rx.text(
                "Get started by editing ",
                rx.code(f"{config.app_name}/{config.app_name}.py"),
                size="5",
            ),

        ),
        rx.logo(),
    )


app = rx.App()
app.add_page(index)
```

Now, its all about adding components to the `def index()`, like: https://reflex.dev/docs/library/data-display/moment/

```py
rx.moment(MomentState.date_now), #you will need to define its associated MomentState(), also given in the docs
```

Not long after get that working, you will **build some demo, using graph components**:

## FAQ


{{< details title="There is a good range of Python web Apps frameworks... üìå" closed="true" >}}


**1. Reflex:**

* **Focus:** Building interactive web apps with a reactive programming model.  It's designed for complex UIs where you need real-time updates and dynamic behavior.
* **Technology:** Uses a Python backend (typically FastAPI) and a frontend built with React.  This allows for a rich, single-page application (SPA) experience.
* **Strengths:** Excellent for data-driven applications, dashboards, and anything requiring frequent UI updates.  The reactive model makes complex interactions manageable.
* **Weaknesses:** Steeper learning curve compared to some other frameworks due to the reactive paradigm and the use of both Python and JavaScript (React under the hood, though you mostly interact with it through Python).  Can be overkill for very simple UIs.

**2. Flet:**

* **Focus:** Creating cross-platform desktop and web applications using Flutter (Google's UI toolkit).
* **Technology:** Python backend with a Flutter frontend.  This enables native-like performance on desktop and a good web experience.
* **Strengths:**  Fast development for both desktop and web from a single codebase.  Good performance and a modern UI.  Relatively easy to learn.
* **Weaknesses:**  While it handles web, its primary strength is cross-platform desktop development.  The UI might not feel *completely* native on the web compared to frameworks specifically designed for the web.

**3. Streamlit:**

* **Focus:** Rapidly building data-driven web applications and dashboards, especially for machine learning and data science.
* **Technology:** Pure Python, and it handles the frontend rendering for you.
* **Strengths:** Extremely easy to learn and use.  Excellent for quickly prototyping and deploying data science tools.  Has built-in support for displaying data visualizations and interactive widgets.
* **Weaknesses:**  Not ideal for complex, highly interactive applications.  The UI is more basic compared to Reflex or Flet.  Not as suitable for apps that require fine-grained UI control or complex event handling.

**4. PySimpleGUI (PyNiceGUI):**

* **Focus:** Making it easy to create simple GUIs in Python.  Its primary focus is on desktop applications.
* **Technology:** Wraps various GUI toolkits (Tkinter, Qt, WxPython, etc.) to provide a simplified API.
* **Strengths:** Very beginner-friendly.  Great for quickly creating simple desktop utilities or tools.
* **Weaknesses:**  Limited in terms of UI customization and modern look and feel.  Not designed for web applications.  While there is a project called NiceGUI which is a separate project from PySimpleGUI that allows you to create web UIs, it's not a direct web equivalent of PySimpleGUI. NiceGUI is more comparable to Streamlit, but with a different syntax and approach.

**Let's summarize the key differences:**

| **Feature**         | Reflex                 | Flet                    | Streamlit              | PySimpleGUI/NiceGUI        |

{{< details title="Django... and what about the UI? üìå" closed="true" >}}

When using Django for the backend, developers have a wide range of choices for their UI frontend.

Here are some of the most common and popular options:

**1. Django's Built-in Templating System:**

* This is the most straightforward option. Django's templating language allows you to embed dynamic content directly within your HTML.
* It's well-suited for simpler applications or when you want tight integration between the backend and frontend.
* Pros: Easy to learn, tightly integrated with Django.
* Cons: Can become less maintainable for complex UIs.

**2. React.js:**

* React is a very popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* It's excellent for creating single-page applications (SPAs) and complex UIs.
* Pros: Component-based architecture, excellent performance, large community.
* Cons: Requires separate development for the frontend and backend, steeper learning curve.
* Often Django Rest Framework is used to create an API that the React front end consumes.

**3. Vue.js:**

* Vue.js is another progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
* It's known for its simplicity and ease of integration.
* Pros: Easy to learn, flexible, good performance.
* Cons: Smaller community compared to React, but growing rapidly.
* Often Django Rest Framework is used to create an API that the Vue.js front end consumes.

**4. Angular:**

* Angular is a powerful JavaScript framework developed by Google.
* It's well-suited for building large-scale applications.
* Pros: Comprehensive framework, strong type checking, good for enterprise applications.
* Cons: Steeper learning curve, can be more complex than React or Vue.
* Often Django Rest Framework is used to create an API that the Angular front end consumes.

**5. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Vanilla):**

* For simpler applications, you can use plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any frameworks.
* This gives you complete control over the frontend.
* Pros: Lightweight, no external dependencies.
* Cons: Can become difficult to manage for complex UIs.

**6. Tailwind CSS:**

* While not a full front end framework, Tailwind CSS is very popular with django projects. It is a utility first CSS framework, that allows for very rapid UI development.
* It can be combined with any of the above, and is most often used with Django's built in templating, or with Vue.js.


{{< /details >}}

**Key Considerations:**

* **Complexity:** For simple applications, Django's templating or vanilla JavaScript might suffice. For complex UIs, React, Vue, or Angular are better choices.
* **Single Page Applications:** If you're building an SPA, React, Vue, or Angular are ideal.
* **Team Expertise:** Choose a technology that your team is comfortable with.
* **API Development:** If you're using a JavaScript framework, you'll need to create an API using Django REST Framework (DRF) to connect the frontend and backend.

In summary, while Django's templating is a valid option, the trend leans heavily towards using JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular for more modern and dynamic user interfaces.
