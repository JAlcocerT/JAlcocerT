I was having a look to https://selfh.st/newsletter/2025-02-07/ and found out about **TinuAuth**

Which seems to integrate with https services and provide an auth layer.


https://tinyauth.doesmycode.work/docs/guides/github-oauth.html

https://github.com/steveiliop56/tinyauth

But whats TinyAuth?

Just a [Okta alternative](https://opensourcealternative.to/?searchTerm=okta), similarly to [Authentik](https://opensourcealternative.to/project/authentik)

### Example TinyAuth

* https://tinyauth.doesmycode.work/docs/getting-started.html


Remember, [generate your keys](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/encryption-101/):

```sh
openssl rand -base64 32
```

{{< details title="TinyAuth Compose with traefik and nginx 📌" closed="true" >}}

```yml

```


{{< /details >}}

This `docker-compose.yml` file defines a setup using Traefik as a reverse proxy, Nginx as a web server, and TinyAuth for authentication.

Let's break down each service:

**1. `traefik` Service:**

*   `container_name: traefik`: Assigns the name "traefik" to the container.
*   `image: traefik:v3.3`: Specifies the Traefik image version to use.
*   `command: --api.insecure=true --providers.docker`: Configures Traefik.
    *   `--api.insecure=true`: Enables the Traefik API in insecure mode.  **This is generally discouraged for production.**  It's useful for development and testing, but in production, you should use a secure API.
    *   `--providers.docker`: Tells Traefik to use Docker as a provider, meaning it will automatically discover and configure routing for other containers based on their labels.
*   `ports: - 80:80`: Maps port 80 on the host to port 80 in the container.  This means that requests to port 80 on your host machine will be forwarded to Traefik.
*   `volumes: - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`: Mounts the Docker socket into the Traefik container. This is how Traefik can communicate with the Docker daemon to discover other containers and configure routing.  **This is a security consideration.**  Only grant access to the Docker socket to trusted containers.
*   `labels:`: These labels are used by Traefik to configure routing and middleware.
    *   `traefik.http.middlewares.tinyauth.forwardauth.address: http://tinyauth:3000/api/auth`: Defines a middleware named "tinyauth".  This middleware uses forward authentication, meaning it will send authentication requests to the TinyAuth service running at `http://tinyauth:3000/api/auth`.

**2. `nginx` Service:**

*   `container_name: nginx`: Assigns the name "nginx" to the container.
*   `image: nginx:latest`: Specifies the Nginx image to use.
*   `labels:`:  Traefik uses these labels for configuration.
    *   `traefik.enable: true`: Tells Traefik to enable routing for this container.
    *   `traefik.http.routers.nginx.rule: Host(\`nginx.example.com\`)`: Defines a router named "nginx".  This router will handle requests to the host `nginx.example.com`.
    *   `traefik.http.services.nginx.loadbalancer.server.port: 80`: Defines a service that points to port 80 of the Nginx container.
    *   `traefik.http.routers.nginx.middlewares: tinyauth`: Applies the "tinyauth" middleware to the "nginx" router.  This means that requests to `nginx.example.com` will be authenticated by TinyAuth before being forwarded to Nginx.

**3. `tinyauth` Service:**

*   `container_name: tinyauth`: Assigns the name "tinyauth" to the container.
*   `image: ghcr.io/steveiliop56/tinyauth:latest`: Specifies the TinyAuth image to use.
*   `environment:`: Sets environment variables for TinyAuth.
    *   `SECRET=some-random-32-chars-string`: Sets the secret used for JWT signing.  **Change this to a strong, randomly generated secret.**
    *   `APP_URL=https://tinyauth.example.com`: Sets the URL of your application.
    *   `USERS=user:$$2a$$10$$UdLYoJ5lgPsC0RKqYH/jMua7zIn0g9kPqWmhYayJYLaZQ/FTmH2/u`: Defines a user "user" with a bcrypt hashed password.  **You should generate a strong password and hash it using bcrypt.**  The `$$` are needed because `$` has a special meaning in YAML.
*   `labels:`:
    *   `traefik.enable: true`: Enables Traefik routing for this container.
    *   `traefik.http.routers.tinyauth.rule: Host(\`tinyauth.example.com\`)`: Defines a router for `tinyauth.example.com`.
    *   `traefik.http.services.tinyauth.loadbalancer.server.port: 3000`: Defines a service pointing to port 3000 of the TinyAuth container.

**How it Works Together:**

1.  A request comes in to `nginx.example.com`.
2.  Traefik, acting as a reverse proxy, receives the request.
3.  Traefik checks the labels and sees that the "tinyauth" middleware is applied to this route.
4.  Traefik forwards the request to the TinyAuth service at `http://tinyauth:3000/api/auth`.
5.  TinyAuth checks the credentials (if any) and authenticates the user.
6.  If authentication is successful, TinyAuth redirects the request back to Traefik.
7.  Traefik then forwards the request to the Nginx container.
8.  Nginx serves the content.

**Key Security Considerations:**

*   **`--api.insecure=true`:**  **Do not use this in production.**  Use a secure API with TLS.
*   **`SECRET`:** Change the `SECRET` environment variable to a strong, randomly generated value.
*   **`USERS`:** Generate a strong password and hash it using bcrypt.  Do not store passwords in plain text.
*   **Docker Socket:** Mounting the Docker socket is a security risk.  Only do this if you trust all the containers that have access to it.  Consider alternative methods if possible.

This setup provides a basic example of how to use Traefik, Nginx, and TinyAuth together.  Remember to address the security concerns before deploying this in a production environment.

What we will need:

1. Docker
2. NGINX to serve a website
3. Traefik providing SSL with your Domain

{{< callout type="info" >}}
To validate that we own the domain, we can do **DNS or TLS Challenge** (the latter requires Port FWD)
{{< /callout >}}

For the **DNS Challenge**, we just need the **API access**, for example to Cloudflare Domains.

```sh
nano docker-compose.yaml
```

```yml

      - "traefik.http.routers.traefik-secure.service=api@internal"


networks:
  proxy:
    name: proxy
    external: true
```

Important:

* `/home/ubuntu/docker/traefik/acme.json` stores the private keys of the certificates
* `/home/ubuntu/docker/traefik/traefik.yml` entry points for traefik
* `/home/ubuntu/docker/traefik/config.yml`
With that, LetsEncrypt will login to the Domain registrar and creates a temporary record.

Then, it will know that you are the one that really own the domain and therefore you can get certificates for that domain.

**How to get API Token from Cloudflare** - DNS Challenge!

Go to My Profile on the top right -> `API Tokens` -> `Create Token` -> Select the `Edit Zone DNS` Template

![Zone DNS CF](/blog_img/selfh/CF-APITokens-ZoneDNS.png)


Keep Permissions Zone: DNS And as Zone Resources you can specify the particular domain (optional).

You will get a way to verify it works:

```sh
curl -X GET "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/user/tokens/verify" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer some-cf-token" \
     -H "Content-Type:application/json"
```

You can use that API into the **Traefik docker-compose below** at `CF_DNS_API_TOKEN`

See that we also have a `traefik.yml` linked in the volumes of this compose.

And the docker network:

```sh
sudo docker network create proxy
```

Acme files can be blank, we will fill `traefik.yml`

{{< tabs items="Files we need,traefik.yml,acme.yml" >}}

  {{< tab >}}
  

```sh
mkdir -p /home/docker/traefik
cd /home/docker/traefik

touch /home/docker/traefik/acme.json #blank, just change the permissions to 600 later (private key)
touch /home/docker/traefik/acme.yml
touch /home/docker/traefik/traefik.yml
```

```sh
chmod 600 ./acme.json && \
chmod 600 ./traefik.yml #or it will be a security risk for other users to see the privatekey
```
  
  
  {{< /tab >}}

  {{< tab >}}
  

With such info:

And last but not least, we need to **create a strong password**

```sh
sudo apt install apache2-utils

#generating a hashed password for the user "admin" using the htpasswd utility
echo $(htpasswd -nb "admin" "admin") | sed -e s/\\$/\\$\\$/g #place the full result into the dockercompose for the dash creds
```

Right on this label of the docker compose: `traefik.http.middlewares.traefik-auth.basicauth.users`

And now, we just do:

```sh
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

And I got this kind of error:

### Updating DNS Records

Before moving forward...make sure that you have proper DNS records at your domain provider.

> See [this script](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Docker/tree/main/Security/DNS/Cloudflare_DNS)

We will need the Cloudflare API and zoneID, which you can get from:

```sh
curl -X GET "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones?name=whateveryourdomainis.com" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer whateveryourAPIis" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Or, if you just want it simple, get the **ZoneID parsed** with:

```sh
curl -X GET "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones?name=whateveryourdomainis.com" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer whateveryourAPIis" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" | jq -r '.result[0].id'
```
