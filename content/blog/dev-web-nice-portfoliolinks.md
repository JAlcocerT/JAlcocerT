**Intro**

A look to the HUGO Theme: https://github.com/jpanther/lynx

And why [showing your work](#a-better-way-to-show-your-work) matters.

+++ How I have deployed to [Github Pages](#hugo-lynx-with-githubpages)


## A Better way to Show your Work

We all have **awsome stuff done**, but on our phone.

Let's give others the chance to benefit from our ideas/project/services.

**Make it available for them.**

{{< callout type="info" >}}
You can do similarly in a VPS Server, like this one we used for Flask
{{< /callout >}}

{{< callout type="info" >}}
I [developed it within my OrangePi with SSH](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/blog/dev-in-docker/) and also had to stop portainer so that TinaCMS could run `sudo docker stop portainer`

### Web Demo Results

See: https://jalcocert.github.io/Portfolio

[!HUGO Lynx](/blog_img/web/WebsSnapshots/Web_PortfolioLinks.png)

#### HUGO LYNX with GithubPages

{{< details title="Proposing a Quick HUGO Theme ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

[JPanther Contributions](https://github.com/jpanther) are amazing.

And the **Lynx Theme** is not an exception.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jpanther/lynx #MIT Licensed, Thanks again, James!
cd ./lynx

git clone https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Portfolio
cd ./Portfolio
```


Get **GO & HUGO Ready** as per [this related post](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/blog/using-hugo-as-website/).

```sh
#sudo apt install ufw
#sudo ufw allow 1313

hugo server #http://192.168.0.117:1313/
#hugo server --bind 0.0.0.0 --baseURL http://192.168.0.117
#hugo server --bind 192.168.0.117 --baseURL http://192.168.0.117 #it will bind it to a random port
hugo server --bind 0.0.0.0 --baseURL http://192.168.0.117 --port 1313 #
```

Now you can dev HUGO as I did, on a [server with VSCode and SSH](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/blog/dev-in-docker/) at: `http://192.168.0.117:1313`
<!-- 
Use the sample site:

```sh
rm -r ./assets && rm -r ./content && rm -r ./layouts && cp -r ./exampleSite/assets . && cp -r ./exampleSite/content . && cp -r ./exampleSite/layouts .
``` -->

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Updating Links"

git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

git branch
git checkout main

#git push origin master
git push origin main
```

{{< /details >}}


It can be built when published to **Github Pages** with this **sample Workflow**: [Dev Hugo -> Push Changes -> CICD Magic](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Portfolio/blob/main/.github/workflows/hugo.yml)

In **less than ~1min**, your site will be refreshed at **Github Pages**.

> Thanks to Github Pages + Github Actions CI/CD!

#### Astro LTree with TinaCMS

Withing Astro, we also have similar *links collector* static themes, like the previous HUGO Lynx.

{{< details title="It all started testing this Astro Theme with TinaCMSðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

* More about [Tina CMS](#faq)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/DBozhinovski/astro-theme-ltree
cd ./astro-theme-ltree

npm install
npm run dev --host #as i was using the Opi
```

And to serve the built files just do: 

```sh
npm run build
npm install -g serve #serve with npm

serve -s dist #http://localhost:3000
```

> Everything worked, so i created this [repo for the project](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/yarness-web)

## Selhostable Link Tools

It requires a server, but it gets the job done and it brigns multi-user, authentication out of the box:

1. [LinkStack](https://linkstack.org/docker/) - Selfhostable with [this docker config](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Docker/blob/main/Web/CMS/LinkStack_docker-compose.yml)

>  A simple to set up [docker variant of LinkStack](https://github.com/linkstackorg/linkstack-docker). 

> > LinkStack is a highly customizable link sharing platform with an intuitive, easy to use user interface.
