During this month, have decided to create a more detail guide on Github Pages on how to get started with a Raspberry Pi.

I will use this content as a personal wiki, so whenever I find some block that requires some effort to find out on the internet, will make a concise guide right here: <https://jalcocert.github.io/RPi/>


<!-- shodan

Shodan is a specialized search engine that allows users to find Internet-connected devices. Unlike traditional search engines that index websites and pages, Shodan collects information about network-connected devices such as servers, security cameras, routers, printers, and IoT (Internet of Things) devices1. Here are some key points about Shodan:

Search Engine for Internet-Connected Devices: Shodan is often referred to as the “world’s first search engine for Internet of Things (IoT) devices.” It provides a way to discover various types of servers, webcams, routers, and other devices connected to the Internet. -->

Search engine similar to Google
What Is Shodan? Shodan is a search engine similar to Google. But while Google searches for websites, Shodan searches for devices that are connected to the internet. Users can perform a search using the Shodan search engine based on an IP address, device name, city, and/or a variety of other technical categories. -->
