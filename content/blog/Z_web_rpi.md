During this month, have decided to create a more **detailed guide on Github Pages on how to get started with a Raspberry Pi.**

I will use this content as a **personal wiki**, so whenever I find some block that requires some effort to find out on the internet, will make a concise guide right here: <https://jalcocert.github.io/RPi/>

So this is kind of website project + IoT and Linux with a Raspberry Pi kind of thing.

## Raspberry Pi Blog with Jekyll Chirpy Theme

Jekyll uses **Ruby language**.

And thanks to the community, there are Themes that you can use completely free.

So: Free Theme, Free Hosting, Free Github(sub)domain...Let's create something interesting with it.

{{< details title="Ruby + jekyll + Chirpy Setup ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

There are two ways!

1. Clone the [starter](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter) and name it as `urusername.github.io`

This will spin up GHPages & GH Action automatically and provide the theme ready for action.


2. Pro way: Also with [GH Pages + Actions WF](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/RPi/blob/main/.github/workflows/jekyll-pages-deploy.yml)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy && cd ./jekyll-theme-chirpy
```

```sh
sudo apt install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev

#https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/#gems
echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/.gem' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/.gem"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.gem/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

gem update --system
gem install jekyll bundler

##ARM64 not there yet
# curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
# source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
# rvm install 3.1
# sudo apt install -y autoconf bison build-essential libssl-dev libyaml-dev libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libffi-dev libgdbm6 libgdbm-dev
# rvm install 3.1 --disable-binary
```

See the magic of **Jekyll+Chirpy** at work:

```sh
#git clone https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy && cd ./jekyll-theme-chirpy

sudo apt install -y nodejs npm #you need npm, (tried with 7.2.0)
bash tools/init.sh #initialize
bundle
bundle exec jekyll s #local server - http://127.0.0.1:4000
#bundle exec jekyll serve --host 192.168.1.100 --port 4000
```

The page logo (favicon) can be changed thanks to the folder `/assets/img`.

Another **important files** are `_data/authors.yml` and `_config.yml`

```yml
baseurl: "/internetofthings"
url: "https://jalcocert.github.io"
```

### HA

**Home Assistant with a Pi** 
- Be aware of the differences between **[HA OS](https://jalcocert.github.io/RPi/posts/getting-started/#home-assistant-os)** and **HA Docker** container!

{{% details title="HAOS vs HA Docker" closed="true" %}}

When considering Home Assistant OS (HAOS) versus a Docker image installation, it boils down to **ease of use versus flexibility and control**. 

**Home Assistant OS (HAOS)**

* **Pros:**
    * **Ease of Use:**
        * HAOS is designed to be a "ready-to-go" solution. It simplifies the installation and management of Home Assistant.
        * The add-on system provides a user-friendly way to install and manage additional services.
        * Automatic updates and simplified backup/restore processes.
    * **Optimized for Home Assistant:**
        * HAOS is specifically tailored to run Home Assistant, which can lead to better performance and stability.
        * Hardware integration is often smoother.
    * **Integrated Supervisor:**
        * The supervisor handles many of the underlying system tasks, making it less necessary for the user to have deep linux system knowledge.

* **Cons:**
    * **Limited Flexibility:**
        * HAOS restricts access to the underlying operating system, which can limit advanced customization.
        * Less control over the system's configuration.
        * Limitations regarding access to hardware drivers.
    * **Less Multi-Purpose:**
        * HAOS is designed primarily for Home Assistant, so it's less suitable for running other applications on the same hardware.

**Home Assistant in Docker**

* **Pros:**
    * **Increased Flexibility:**
        * Docker allows for greater control over the Home Assistant environment.
        * You can easily run other applications alongside Home Assistant on the same machine.
        * You have more control over networking, resource allocation, and updates.
    * **Portability:**
        * Docker containers can be easily moved between different systems.
        * Enables use of existing infrastructure, if you already use docker.
    * **Resource Management:**
        * Docker allows you to precisely manage the resources allocated to Home Assistant.

* **Cons:**
    * **Increased Complexity:**
        * Setting up and managing Home Assistant in Docker requires more technical knowledge.
        * Managing add-ons becomes a manual process, as they are not directly supported in the same way as HAOS.
        * Updates and backups require more manual intervention.
    * **Potential Compatibility Issues:**
        * Hardware integration can be more complex, and some devices may require additional configuration.
    * Losing the ease of use of the supervisor, and add-on store.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
HA Docker is more portable, but add-ons not supported out of the box in there!
{{< /callout >}}

* If you prioritize simplicity and ease of use, HAOS is likely the better choice.
* If you need maximum flexibility and control, or if you plan to run other applications on the same hardware, Docker is the way to go.

{{% details title="Integrations vs add-ons in Home Assistant" closed="true" %}}

Integrations and add-ons in Home Assistant serve distinct purposes, and it's important to understand the difference. Here's a breakdown:

**Integrations:**

* **Purpose:**
    * Integrations allow Home Assistant to connect and communicate with various devices, services, and platforms. They essentially act as "translators," enabling Home Assistant to understand and interact with different systems.
    * Examples: Philips Hue integration, Z-Wave integration, MQTT integration.
    * They bring data into Home assistant, and allow home assistant to control external devices and services.
* **Function:**
    * They define how Home Assistant interacts with specific devices or services, defining the entities (sensors, switches, etc.) that represent those devices within Home Assistant.
    * Integrations are core to Home Assistant's functionality, allowing it to control and monitor your smart home devices.

**Add-ons:**

* **Purpose:**
    * Add-ons are additional, standalone software packages that run alongside Home Assistant.
    * They provide extra functionalities or services that Home Assistant can utilize.
    * Examples: Mosquitto MQTT broker, Node-RED, a file editor.
* **Function:**
    * They are essentially Docker containers that are managed by the Home Assistant Supervisor (in HAOS or Supervised installations).
    * They often provide services that integrations can then connect to. For example, the MQTT add-on provides an MQTT broker, and the MQTT integration allows Home Assistant to use that broker.
    * Addons expand the abilities of the Home assistant operating system, by adding extra software.

**Key Differences:**

* **Functionality:**
    * Integrations enable Home Assistant to talk to devices and services.
    * Add-ons provide additional software and services that Home Assistant can use.
* **Implementation:**
    * Integrations are typically built into Home Assistant or installed as custom components.
    * Add-ons are separate applications that run in Docker containers.
* **Dependancy:**
    * Often an integration will require an addon to function. For example, using Zwave devices, often requires a zwave management addon.
