If you are flooded with ideas, you need some way to prioritize them.

In case that you want to let people be the ones telling what you are building, you need some way of getting to know what they want.

The ultimage validator is your Stripe paywall.

And yet, you can have some idea by listening what your potential client tells they they want.
