**Intro**

Have your client in the loop asap.

Thats one of the outcomes of *the [lean](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/lean/) startup*

So when the code works on your machine: *how about sharing it with real users?*

## VPS

VPS, just a computer somewhere else in the world.

I started using GCP free tier to get started with cloud.

> Later, I got dissapointed with Oracle Cloud.

Then decided to try these VPS for fun and see how my linux skills got better.

Any of these can help you serve your Apps to people, unless you want to do so from your homelab!

##  Others

### Elestio

I used https://elest.io/ to try some open source projects.

Their mission is great:

>  Fully managed DevOps platform to deploy your code and open-source software 

* You manage it all from https://dash.elest.io/login

They also provide guides and high level features on the OSS projects.

## Conclusions

Its up to you:

1. Get a [x300](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/asrock-x300-home-server/#energy-x300), get a ~15w avg at 0,25eur/kwh will cost you ~32eur/y (or 2,74 a month)

2. Deploy on one of [these smaller](#vps) servers for a little bit more of the price, but you forget about the initial costs.

2. **VPNs**: Like Mullvad or ProtonVPN as covered [here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/homelab-security/#vpn)

3. Get https/SSL via Cloudflare tunnel or Traefik v3.3 setup.
