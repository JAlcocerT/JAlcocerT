**Intro**

## Business OSS Driven

Make sure to understand the licenses.

MIT, Apache v2 will work.

You can get around with open source for:

1. Creating Invoices: There are several ways to do so, but I like the simplicity of serverless-invoices
2. Receiving payments: Stripe API is great and simplify a lot of things.

### Monitoring

So you are already having few SaaS.

Most of the sites are reciving no traffic.

But there is that idea taking over.

Is your VPS server fried already?

Figure that out with these OSS Monitoring Tools:

* Monitor your vendors
