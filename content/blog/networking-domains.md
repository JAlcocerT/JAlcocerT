To point a subdomain to an IPv4 or IPv6 address, you need to create specific DNS records. Hereâ€™s what you need to do:

### 1. **Pointing to an IPv4 Address**

- **Record Type:** `A`
- **Name:** `subdomain.yourdomain.com`
- **Value:** The IPv4 address you want to point to.

### Example:
If your subdomain is `app.example.com` and the IPv4 address is `192.168.1.1`, your DNS record should look like:

| Type | Name            | Value        |
|------|-----------------|--------------|
| A    | app.example.com | 192.168.1.1  |

### 2. **Pointing to an IPv6 Address**

- **Record Type:** `AAAA`
- **Name:** `subdomain.yourdomain.com`
- **Value:** The IPv6 address you want to point to.

### Example:
If your subdomain is `app.example.com` and the IPv6 address is `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`, your DNS record should look like:

| Type  | Name            | Value                                   |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| AAAA  | app.example.com | 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 |

### **Summary:**

- Use an `A` record to point a subdomain to an IPv4 address.
- Use an `AAAA` record to point a subdomain to an IPv6 address.

Make sure to replace `subdomain.yourdomain.com` with your actual subdomain, and `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain name.
