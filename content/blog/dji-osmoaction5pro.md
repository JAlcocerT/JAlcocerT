First, A photo of the **latest DJI Action Camera**:

![DJI Osmo Action 5 Pro](/blog_img/hardware/dji_oa5pro.jpg)

And some **test video**:

{{< youtube "MlbJ3tY43vE" >}}

<!-- https://demo.mediacms.io/view?m=ZLjVzLcCE

{{< video "https://www.w3schools.com/tags/movie.mp4" >}} -->


{{< callout type="info" >}}
The [Pixel 8 Pro](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/pixel-8-pro-tricks/) is behaving perfectly for videos, but I wanted to try sth different.
{{< /callout >}}

It's gonna be a companion for the **[next adventures](#adventures)**

![Karting Adventure](/blog_img/Accidente_karting-min.gif)

Definitely a huge upgrade in quality to the [RPi Camera I tested](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/raspberry-pi-camera-setup/)


### DJi OA5Pro Video Quality

Very simple: From 1080p, to 4K videos.

Ratios 4:3 or 16:9, which is the one you one to use for Youtube, for example.

This is a 2.7K Video example, meaning 2688x1512 at 50FPS, during the day:

{{< youtube "cqs4MkJ_4M4" >}}

{{< callout type="info" >}}
A regular TV can be **4K UHD, meaning 3840x2160**.
Be aware when recording that it can do x2160 or other, depending if you choose W/UW and so on
{{< /callout >}}

<!-- 
but also x3840x1600? UW??? -->

```sh
sudo apt install mediainfo
mediainfo outputvideo.MP4 #ViesiejaiNightWalk.mp4
```

> Check video resolution, fps and more with [this script](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/YT-Video-Edition/blob/main/With_FFmpeg/z_video_info.sh)

### How to edit Videos

{{< callout type="info" >}}
How to [setup your PC for content creation](https://jalcocert.github.io/Linux/docs/debian/content_creation/): OBSStudio, Shotcut, KDenLive...
{{< /callout >}}

For simple cuts, I found easier to use ShotCut:

{{< details title="Shotcut with OA5 Proüìå" closed="true" >}}

```sh
sudo snap install shotcut --classic
```

1. Open Shotcut, **add the .mp4 file** (not the [DJI's LRF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JAlcocerT/Docker/refs/heads/main/Backups/NextCloud/nc_mariadb.yml) - Low Resolution File used for the video playback)
2. On the top left side - **add filter**: audio mute / brightness / ...
3. When you are done with the changes: **CTRL+E to export as .mp4**

{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="KDEnlive with OA5Pro üìå" closed="true" >}}

```sh
#sudo snap install shotcut --classic
```

1. Open Shotcut, add the .mp4 file (not the [DJI's LRF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JAlcocerT/Docker/refs/heads/main/Backups/NextCloud/nc_mariadb.yml) - Low Resolution File used for the video playback)
2. On the top left side: add filter: audio mute

## Conclusions of Osmo Action 5 Pro

Make sure to **explore the resolutions and modes**.

It can do photo and video. But for photo I still prefer [the Pixel](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/pixel-8-pro-tricks)

There is the possibility to record at FHD 1080p@240fps, but not with wide mode, for example.

* Video Modes
   * TimeLapse 1h/3s Sunset Scene - 1080p@30 aka **1080P30/3s**- It makes 1 real hour to be 40s in the video and 93mb - 2.3mb/s
      * It can also be 2.7k and 4k
   * Hyperlapse during the night was having some glitches

* You are required to [install DJI Mimo app](https://www.dji.com/pl/downloads/djiapp/dji-mimo) at least to get started.
    * The App allow you to activate the warranty + transfer files (no need for cable!) + receive firmware updates

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
* The app is neither in Google not Apple store...‚ùó
* I would keep the .apk handy, as per my experience with the [DJI Tello Drone](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/dji-tello-python-programming/)
{{< /callout >}}


{{< callout type="info" >}}
As they required email registration, I put to test how seriously DJI takes privacy by using **[addy.io](https://github.com/anonaddy/docker) email aliases** ([ex-anonaddy](https://github.com/anonaddy/anonaddy?tab=readme-ov-file#will-people-see-my-real-email-if-i-reply-to-a-forwarded-one))
{{< /callout >}}

<!--

-->

* The **battery is 1950mah** and charges really fast üëå
    * From 10% to 80% - ~30 min
    * From 10% to 100% - ~40 min
    * If you leave the battery connected, it will loose ~2% charge during a night
    * Here is an estimate of [space vs quality](#space-vs-quality)

{{< details title="Battery Drain Tests üìå" closed="true" >}}

1. **0% to 60% at 23W**  
   - `Time = Energy for 60% √∑ 23W`

2. **60% to 85% at 17W**  
   - `Time = Energy for 25% √∑ 17W`

3. **85% to 100% at 9W**  
   - `Time = Energy for 15% √∑ 9W`

4. **Total Time**  
   - `Total Time = Time (0-60%) + Time (60-85%) + Time (85-100%)` ~ 30 min
{{< /details >}}

* Memory wise 
    * The built in is ~45GB üëå
    * I added a **Kingston SD** 128GB CL10 (up to 80mb/s reading and **10 mb/s of writing** - which might be to slow)
        * It is enough to record in there video at 1080p@30fps **without micro-stops**
         * 1080p@30fps is around 4mb/s in size
         * FHD - 1080@60fps/RS+/UW, its ~5mb/s and also works
        * **Even 2.7k@30fps/RS/UltraWide works!** It's ~5.6mb/s in average size
        * 2.7k@30/RS+/UW, but I prefered the quality of the RS mode
        * 4K@25/rs/uw
        * And I got to **work in the SD** 4K@48/ / at ~7.5 mb/s
        * 4k@100/RS+/UW - ~ 10min ~ 10% battery drained
    * When transfering files to my laptop I saw up to **90MB/s** speed (reading from SD, writing to SSD) via usb-c (when transfering to the [FireBat](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/firebat-ak2-plus-minipc-review/) via USB3.0 it drops to 25-30mb/s)

* Transfering files:
    * Via the Mimo App
    * Via usb-c (**turn ON the camera first** and then connect the cable)
        * You will see one drive for the internal card and another for your SD card if any
        * Transfer speed is ~25mb/s from the internal SD card. To the [ThinkPad](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/laptop-lenovo-thinkpad-x13-benchmark/) I saw ~28

* File size:
    * Super night mode FHD (**Full HD**) 1920x**1080@30fps** has a 29.5mb/s video bitrate, making a 4.4gb for 20min duration. 
    * Super night mode with UHD (Ultra High Definition) **3840**x2160@30fps - **4k**@30fps makes a ~8gb file for 20 min duration and used 20% battery - the super night mode needs stabilization ON
    * **2688**x1522 resolution, aka 2.7K

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
Stabilization is great during the day, but **not during the night.**

### My Workflow with the DJI OA5-Pro

I got inspired by this post: https://www.vanwerkhoven.org/blog/2021/photography-image-processing-workflow/

And this is what I created so far...


{{< callout type="info" >}}
I decided to create [this repo with the **scripts**](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/YT-Video-Edition)
{{< /callout >}}

{{< details title="Scaling video resolution with - Upscayl + Shotcut üìå" closed="true" >}}

Delete the LRF files:

```sh
du -h --max-depth=1 #check space
find . -name "*.LRF" -type f -delete #cleaning .LRF
```
And get VLC to see them:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install vlc
```

{{< /details >}}


See **info about .MP4's** in your folder:


{{< details title="Video CLI ordering files, editing - v1 with FFmpeg üìå" closed="true" >}}

Get the pkg installed:

```sh
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

```sh
#find . -type f -name "*.MP4" -exec ffprobe {} \;
#find . -type f -name "*.MP4" -exec ffprobe -v error -show_entries format=duration -of default=noprint_wrappers=1:nokey=1 {} \;

#check .MP$ info recursively
find . -type f -iname "*.mp4" -exec bash -c '
  for file; do
    name=$(basename "$file")
    duration=$(ffprobe -v error -select_streams v:0 -show_entries format=duration -of default=noprint_wrappers=1:nokey=1 "$file")
    size=$(stat --format="%s" "$file")
    resolution=$(ffprobe -v error -select_streams v:0 -show_entries stream=width,height -of csv=s=x:p=0 "$file")
    
    # FPS extraction
    fps_raw=$(ffprobe -v error -select_streams v:0 -show_entries stream=r_frame_rate -of csv=p=0 "$file")
    fps=$(echo "$fps_raw" | awk -F "/" '"'"'{ if ($2) print $1/$2; else print $1 }'"'"')

    # Bitrate extraction in kbps
    bitrate_bps=$(ffprobe -v error -show_entries format=bit_rate -of default=noprint_wrappers=1:nokey=1 "$file")
    bitrate_kbps=$(echo "scale=2; $bitrate_bps / 1000" | bc -l)
    
    # Average MB/s calculation
    avg_mbps=$(echo "scale=2; $bitrate_bps / 1000000000" | bc -l)

    echo "Name: $name - Duration: ${duration}s - Size: ${size} GB - Resolution: $resolution - FPS: $fps - Bitrate: ${bitrate_kbps}kbps - Avg MB/s: ${avg_mbps}MB/s"
  done
' bash {} +
```

More info about your .MP4 Videos

```sh
for video in *.MP4; do
    echo "File: $video"
    mediainfo "$video" | grep -E 'Rotation|Width|Height|Format|Duration'
done
```

or with:

```sh
for video in *.MP4; do
    echo "File: $video"
    ffprobe "$video"
done
```

I ordered them like so: `chmod +x organize_videos.sh ./organize_videos.sh`

```sh
#!/bin/bash

#IT WILL MOVE THEM TO THE LOCATION WHERE YOU RUN THIS
# Check for ffprobe installation
if ! command -v ffprobe &> /dev/null; then
  echo "ffprobe could not be found. Please install ffmpeg."
  exit 1
fi

# Find and organize .mp4 files based on resolution
find . -type f -iname "*.mp4" | while read -r file; do
  name=$(basename "$file")
  resolution=$(ffprobe -v error -select_streams v:0 -show_entries stream=width,height -of csv=s=x:p=0 "$file")

  # Construct the folder name based on resolution
  folder_name="$resolution"
  
  # Create the destination folder if it doesn't exist
  mkdir -p "$folder_name"

  # Move the file to the destination folder
  mv "$file" "$folder_name/"
  
  # Output information about the file
  echo "Moved: $name to $folder_name"
done
```

or creating the subfolder in their find location....but not today.


{{< /details >}}

Let's jump to editing:

* [Cut a video with KDenLive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKRKv2ogKU&list=PLqazFFzUAPc7uQaoGxYwxGLk4_6fQrBvE&index=2)
    * When ready, hit **CTRL+Enter to render**

> And this was soooo slow, can I just **join some videos together?**

**YES, CLI can, thanks to ffmpeg pkg**

```sh
ls *.MP4 | sed "s/^/file '/; s/$/'/" > file_list.txt #add .mp4 of current folder to a list

#du -sh ./* #check their size

#generate a video with them
ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i file_list.txt -c copy output_video.mp4
#ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i file_list.txt -c:v copy -an output_video.mp4 #silenced video
#ffmpeg -i output_video.mp4 -filter:v "setpts=PTS/4" -an fast_output_video.mp4 #
```

**Check what was created:** in this case, the `output_video.mp4` file

```sh
size=$(ffprobe -v error -select_streams v:0 -show_entries format=size -of default=noprint_wrappers=1:nokey=1 output_video.mp4) && \
duration=$(ffprobe -v error -select_streams v:0 -show_entries format=duration -of default=noprint_wrappers=1:nokey=1 output_video.mp4) && \
fps=$(ffprobe -v error -select_streams v:0 -show_entries stream=r_frame_rate -of default=noprint_wrappers=1:nokey=1 output_video.mp4 | bc) && \
resolution=$(ffprobe -v error -select_streams v:0 -show_entries stream=width,height -of csv=p=0:s=x output_video.mp4) && \
echo "File: output_video.mp4" && \
echo "Size: $(awk "BEGIN {printf \"%.2f GB\", $size / (1024^3)}")" && \
echo "Duration: $(awk "BEGIN {printf \"%.2f minutes\", $duration / 60}")" && \
echo "Resolution: $resolution" && \
echo "FPS: $fps"
```

{{< callout type="info" >}}
* It works fine as we have videos with same resolution on each folder already
* If FPS are different, it will preserve the lower one
{{< /callout >}}


Before going to YT, I like to have **Brave Browser**:

```sh
sudo snap install brave
```
