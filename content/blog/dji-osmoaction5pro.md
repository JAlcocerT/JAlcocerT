## Conclusions of Osmo Action 5 Pro

* You are required to [install DJI Mimo app](https://www.dji.com/pl/downloads/djiapp/dji-mimo) - which will allow you to activate the warranty + transfer files (no need for cable!) + receive firmware updates
    * The app is neither in Google not Apple store...‚ùó

As they required email registration, I put to test how seriously DJI takes privacy by using **[addy.io](https://github.com/anonaddy/docker) email aliases** ([ex-anonaddy](https://github.com/anonaddy/anonaddy?tab=readme-ov-file#will-people-see-my-real-email-if-i-reply-to-a-forwarded-one))

* The battery is 1950mah and charges really fast (~7w) üëå
    * From 10% to 80% - ~30 min
    * From 10% to 100% - ~40 min

* Memory wise üëå
    * The built in is ~45GB
    * I added a Kingston SD 128GB CL10 (up to 80mb/s reading and 10 mb/s of writing - which might be to slow)
    * When transfering files to my laptop I saw up to 90MB/s speed

* File size:
    * Super night mode 1920x**1080@30fps** has a 29.5mb/s video bitrate, making a 4.4gb for 20min duration.
