**Tl;DR**

Because astro SSG and CSR are so cool. Creating a DIY podcast platform.

**Intro**

I read this [lifestyle post](https://quiethabits.net/why-im-ditching-the-best-things-for-the-right-things) and this: https://quiethabits.net/stop-living-a-passive-life

And found that the writer had a podcast: https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/quiethabits/

But only using third party tools.

> Wouldnt it be cool for the author to have its platform?

Lately Iv been tinkering with custom (vibecoded) flask apps to interact with SSGs

1. Clone the repo

```sh

```

2. Bring the astropod theme


3. Edit the `./src` content via the Flask Web App
