## Container Tech is Cool

Containers are an essential tool for simplifying self-hosting software. They give us:

- **Portability**: Containers ensure that your software runs consistently across different environments (development, testing, production).
- **Scalability**: Easily replicated and orchestrated, containers allow for dynamic scaling, particularly in cloud environments.
- **Isolation**: Containers isolate applications, preventing conflicts between dependencies.
- **Efficiency**: Containers share the host OS kernel, making them more resource-efficient and faster than virtual machines. 

More? **Coderized** have a couple of very interesting and well edited videos [about containers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0NuOlA2xDc&t=7s).

**What Are Containers?**

Containers are **lightweight, portable, and self-contained units of software** that package an application along with its dependencies, libraries, and configurations.

This makes it possible to run the software seamlessly across different environments.

Unlike virtual machines, containers share the host system‚Äôs OS kernel, making them faster to deploy and more efficient.

**Prerequisites for Containers**

Before you can use containers, you need to set up the required tools. Below are the steps for setting up **Docker** and **Podman**, two of the most popular containerization tools.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
You can use the SelfHosting script I prepared [here](https://jalcocert.github.io/Linux/docs/linux__cloud/selfhosting/)

### Docker Setup

1. **Install Docker**:
   - **On Linux**:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```
- For more installation details, check Docker's [official guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

2. **Verify Installation**:
   - Check Docker version:
```bash
docker --version
```
   - Run a simple container to test:
```bash
docker run hello-world
```

3. **Post-Installation**:
   - To avoid using `sudo` with Docker commands on Linux:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

4. **Start Using Docker**:
   - Common commands: `docker build`, `docker run`, `docker ps`. Try pulling images from Docker Hub (e.g., `docker pull ubuntu`).

### Podman Setup

1. **Install Podman**:
   - **On Linux**:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install podman
```

2. **Verify Installation**:
   - Check the Podman version:
```bash
podman --version
```

3. **Test Podman**:
   - Run a test container:
```bash
podman run hello-world
```

4. **Post-Installation**:
   - Add your user to the Podman group:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG podman $USER
```

5. **Start Using Podman**:
   - Podman commands are similar to Docker‚Äôs. Start using commands like `podman build`, `podman run`, and `podman ps`.

{{< details title="Why Docker is great to deploy to a VPS? üìå" closed="true" >}}

Dreams of Code, a Senior NYT Reporter, explains their preference for Docker Stack over Docker Compose for VPS deployments.

*   **Secrets Management:** Docker Stack allows external secrets management, separate from the Docker Stack YAML file, which can be linked to environment variables for database and web app services.  This promotes secure secret storage.
*   **Redeploying Applications:** Docker Compose can lead to downtime during redeployments as it shuts down running services before deploying upgrades.  Manually copying the Docker Compose YAML file also hinders agile deployments.
*   **Docker Stack Deployment:** Docker Stack extends Docker Compose by deploying Docker Compose files on a Docker Swarm enabled node. Swarm mode provides features like blue-green deployments, rolling releases, secure secrets management, service rollbacks, and clustering.
*   **Automated Deployments:** Docker Stack integrates with GitHub Actions for automated deployments. GitHub Actions pipeline workflow files manage the Docker Stack deployment process.

**Key Takeaways:**
    *   Docker Stack improves upon Docker Compose for seamless and secure VPS application deployments.
    *   Docker Context simplifies managing and deploying to multiple VPS instances from a workstation.
    *   Docker Stack's secrets management, rollback capabilities, and built-in load balancing enhance production services and developer experience.
    *   Combining [Docker Stack with GitHub Actions](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/github-actions-use-cases/) streamlines CI/CD, ensuring fast, secure deployments with minimal manual effort.

Learn how to securely expose your self-hosted services (Including AI Apps!) using Cloudflare's Zero Trust Tunnel with Docker

**What is Cloudflare Zero Trust Tunnel?**

Cloudflare Zero Tunnel creates a secure connection between your local machine and Cloudflare's global edge network.

It allows private resources to be accessed without exposing them to the public internet, providing enhanced security and privacy.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Improved Security:** End-to-end encryption (TLS 1.3) for safe data transmission.
- **Increased Privacy:** Avoid exposing private resources to the public internet.
- **Global Accessibility:** Access your services securely from anywhere.
- **Faster Connections:** QUIC protocol for more reliable and faster connections.


Docker allows you to containerize and deploy applications easily.

By combining **Docker with Cloudflare Zero Tunnel**, we can securely expose services on the internet.

1. **Create a Docker container for your service**  
   Use Docker to package your application, such as a Python-based web service, in a container.

2. **Install Cloudflare Zero Tunnel Client**  
   - Use the Cloudflare [cloudflared Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/cloudflare/cloudflared).
   - Configure the Cloudflare Zero Tunnel by setting up a token in the Cloudflare Dashboard.

3. **Set Up Cloudflare Tunnel with Docker**  
   - Run `cloudflared` as a container linked to your own services:
   
```bash
#it will be created automatically and called: cloudflared_tunnel as per the <containername><networkname>
#docker network create tunnel
```

```yml
#version: '3.8'

services:
  cloudflared:
    image: cloudflare/cloudflared:latest
    container_name: cloudflared
    command: tunnel --no-autoupdate run --token token_from_cloudflare_webUI #see video below
    networks:
      - tunnel #a name for the Cloudflare Network
    restart: always #unless-stopped

networks:
  tunnel: #a name for the Cloudflare Network
```

4. **Connect Your Service to the Tunnel Network**  
   Add your service container to the Cloudflare tunnel network:
   
```bash
docker network connect tunnel your_service_container
```

5. **Configure a Public Hostname on Cloudflare**  
   In the Cloudflare Dashboard, create a public hostname for your service, linking it to the service container using the format `your_service_name:docker_port`.

### Creating Containers

{{< callout type="info" >}}
You can **create Containers Automatically** thanks to [CI/CD Tools, like Github Actions](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/github-actions-use-cases/)
{{< /callout >}}

Just **recently**, we can use not only x86 VM with github to build our containers, but **also native ARM** (we can skip emulating it with QEMU).

if you want to create containers on your own hardware (but automatically), you can use:

1. Github/Gitlab Runners
2. Gitea Act Runner
3. Jenkins CI/CD
4. Argo CI/CD

{{< details title="Is my home IP safe with Cloudflare? üìå" closed="true" >}}

**Argo CD** is a declarative, **GitOps continuous delivery tool** specifically designed for **Kubernetes**.

It operates based on the principle that your Git repository serves as the single source of truth for your desired application state. 

How Argo CD works?

1. **Define Desired State:** You define your desired application state (e.g., deployments, services, configurations) in your Git repository using Kubernetes manifests.
2. **Argo CD Monitors:** Argo CD continuously monitors your Git repository for changes.
3. **Automatic Synchronization:** When changes are detected, Argo CD automatically synchronizes your Kubernetes cluster to match the desired state defined in Git.
4. **Continuous Reconciliation:** Argo CD constantly compares the actual state of your cluster with the desired state in Git. If discrepancies are found, it takes corrective actions to bring the cluster back in sync.

**Comparison with Jenkins and GitHub Actions:**

| Feature | Argo CD | Jenkins | GitHub Actions |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Focus** | Kubernetes-native GitOps CD | General-purpose CI/CD | CI/CD specifically for GitHub |
| **Deployment Model** | Pull-based (Git as source of truth) | Push-based (CI/CD system triggers deployments) | Push-based |
| **Strengths** | Excellent for Kubernetes deployments, strong GitOps implementation, declarative approach | Highly flexible and customizable, vast plugin ecosystem | Tight integration with GitHub, user-friendly interface |
| **Weaknesses** | Primarily focused on Kubernetes, might have a steeper learning curve for non-Kubernetes users | Can become complex for intricate pipelines, potential for configuration drift | Limited to GitHub repositories |

**In essence:**

* **Argo CD** excels in Kubernetes environments, emphasizing GitOps principles for streamlined and reliable deployments.The bestThe best choice depends on your specific requirements, team expertise, and the complexity of your CI/CD pipelines.
 choice depends on your specific requirements, team expertise, and the complexity of your CI/CD pipelines.
