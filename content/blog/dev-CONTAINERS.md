## Container Tech is Cool

Containers are an essential tool for simplifying self-hosting software. They give us:

- **Portability**: Containers ensure that your software runs consistently across different environments (development, testing, production).
- **Scalability**: Easily replicated and orchestrated, containers allow for dynamic scaling, particularly in cloud environments.
- **Isolation**: Containers isolate applications, preventing conflicts between dependencies.
- **Efficiency**: Containers share the host OS kernel, making them more resource-efficient and faster than virtual machines.

**What Are Containers?**

Containers are **lightweight, portable, and self-contained units of software** that package an application along with its dependencies, libraries, and configurations.

This makes it possible to run the software seamlessly across different environments.

Unlike virtual machines, containers share the host systemâ€™s OS kernel, making them faster to deploy and more efficient.

**Prerequisites for Containers**

Before you can use containers, you need to set up the required tools. Below are the steps for setting up **Docker** and **Podman**, two of the most popular containerization tools.

### Docker Setup

1. **Install Docker**:
   - **On Linux**:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```
   - For more installation details, check Docker's [official guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

2. **Verify Installation**:
   - Check Docker version:
```bash
docker --version
```
   - Run a simple container to test:
```bash
docker run hello-world
```

3. **Post-Installation**:
   - To avoid using `sudo` with Docker commands on Linux:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

4. **Start Using Docker**:
   - Common commands: `docker build`, `docker run`, `docker ps`. Try pulling images from Docker Hub (e.g., `docker pull ubuntu`).

### Podman Setup

1. **Install Podman**:
   - **On Linux**:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install podman
```

2. **Verify Installation**:
   - Check the Podman version:
```bash
podman --version
```

3. **Test Podman**:
   - Run a test container:
```bash
podman run hello-world
```

4. **Post-Installation**:
   - Add your user to the Podman group:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG podman $USER
```

5. **Start Using Podman**:
   - Podman commands are similar to Dockerâ€™s. Start using commands like `podman build`, `podman run`, and `podman ps`.



{{< details title="UI Tools for Managing Containers ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}



While Docker and Podman are command-line tools, there are several **UI tools** that make managing containers easier and more intuitive. Here are some popular options:

1. **Portainer**

- **Platform**: Linux, Windows, macOS
- Portainer is a popular open-source web-based UI for managing Docker and Podman containers.
- **Installation Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 9000:9000 --name=portainer --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer-ce
  ```
  Access Portainer at: `http://localhost:9000`.

2. **Dockge**

- **Platform**: Docker-based UI for container management.
- **Installation Command**:
  ```bash
  docker run -d \
    --name dockge \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    -p 5001:5001 \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v /home/your_user/Desktop/Dockge/data:/app/data \
    louislam/dockge:1
  ```
  Access Dockge at: `http://localhost:5001`.

3. **Cockpit**

- **Platform**: Linux (CentOS, Fedora, Ubuntu)
- Cockpit is a server management tool with a web-based UI for container management.
- **Installation Command**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install cockpit
  sudo systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket
  ```

4. **Kitematic (for Docker)**

- **Platform**: Windows/macOS
- Kitematic is a simple GUI for Docker that makes it easier to create, configure, and run containers.

5. **Yacht**

- **Platform**: Web-based UI for Docker containers.
- Learn more about Yacht from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xc94HJn1nNo) or check its [GitHub page](https://github.com/SelfhostedPro/Yacht).

These tools simplify the process of managing containers, especially if you prefer not to work exclusively with the command line.

Setting up Docker or Podman is straightforward, and with UI tools like Portainer, Dockge, and others, managing your containers has never been easier.

## Easy SelfHosting with Containers

### Exposing Apps Safely with Cloudflare Tunnels

Learn how to securely expose your self-hosted services (Including AI Apps!) using Cloudflare's Zero Trust Tunnel with Docker

**What is Cloudflare Zero Trust Tunnel?**

Cloudflare Zero Tunnel creates a secure connection between your local machine and Cloudflare's global edge network.

It allows private resources to be accessed without exposing them to the public internet, providing enhanced security and privacy.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Improved Security:** End-to-end encryption (TLS 1.3) for safe data transmission.
- **Increased Privacy:** Avoid exposing private resources to the public internet.
- **Global Accessibility:** Access your services securely from anywhere.
- **Faster Connections:** QUIC protocol for more reliable and faster connections.


Docker allows you to containerize and deploy applications easily.

By combining **Docker with Cloudflare Zero Tunnel**, we can securely expose services on the internet.

1. **Create a Docker container for your service**  
   Use Docker to package your application, such as a Python-based web service, in a container.

2. **Install Cloudflare Zero Tunnel Client**  
   - Use the Cloudflare [cloudflared Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/cloudflare/cloudflared).
   - Configure the Cloudflare Zero Tunnel by setting up a token in the Cloudflare Dashboard.

3. **Set Up Cloudflare Tunnel with Docker**  
   - Run `cloudflared` as a container linked to your own services:
   
```bash
docker network create tunnel
```

```yml
version: '3.8'

services:
  cloudflared:
    image: cloudflare/cloudflared:latest
    container_name: cloudflared
    command: tunnel --no-autoupdate run --token token_from_cloudflare_webUI #see video below
    networks:
      - tunnel #a name for the Cloudflare Network
    restart: always #unless-stopped

networks:
  tunnel: #a name for the Cloudflare Network
```

4. **Connect Your Service to the Tunnel Network**  
   Add your service container to the Cloudflare tunnel network:
   
```bash
docker network connect tunnel your_service_container
```

5. **Configure a Public Hostname on Cloudflare**  
   In the Cloudflare Dashboard, create a public hostname for your service, linking it to the service container using the format `your_service_name:docker_port`.
