It all started with the [**AIssistant** post](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/ai-useful-yet-simple/#slides-creation-agent).

But the **AI powered PPT creator** deserves a separate post.

Lets use LLMs to create PPTs!


## Understanding PPT as a Code Frameworks

[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=marp-team/marpit,slidevjs/slidev,remarkjs/remark&,type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#marp-team/marpit&slidevjs/slidev&remarkjs/remark&Date)

### SliDev


[SliDev is an awsome project](https://fossengineer.com/how-to-use-slidev/) to generate PPT as code - **leveraging VueJS framework**.

> I love the SliDev project so much, that [I forked it](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/slidev).

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**SliDev** can be deployed as static sites to [**GH Pages** with GH Actions CI/CD](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Streamlit-MultiChat/blob/main/.github/workflows/SliDev_CICD.yml)
{{< /callout >}}

> See the result: https://jalcocert.github.io/Streamlit-MultiChat/1


[Setup a SliDev Project](https://fossengineer.com/how-to-use-slidev/#the-slidev-project), like any other SSG:

1. Get Node and NPM
2. Initialize the SliDev project

```sh
npm init slidev #yarn create slidev
#npm run dev #if you want to restart where you left it
```

```sh
npm install -g @slidev/cli #npm install --save-dev @slidev/cli
npm i -D playwright-chromium
```

3. Modify the `slides.md` - Make changes to your ppt via markdown  

> It can create a [PPT assistant](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/ai-useful-yet-simple/#slides-creation-agent) as seen on [this post](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/creating-presentations-with-ai/)

### Marp

You can also create **PPTs from markdown** with [Marp](https://github.com/marp-team/marpit)

[Two other options](https://fossengineer.com/create-ppt-with-code/#marp) to create PPTs as a Code.

### RemarkJS

With [RemarkJS](https://fossengineer.com/create-ppt-with-code/#remark)

## Conclusions


Need additionally **mockup tools**?

{{< details title="There is a good range of Mock-up Tools... ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

There are several open-source and self-hostable mockup and wireframing tools available. Here are some of the most popular and feature-rich options:

**Mockup and Prototyping Tools:**

* **Penpot:**  This is a very strong contender and a direct competitor to Figma.  It's completely open source (using SVG as its native format), web-based, and designed for collaborative work.  It's definitely worth checking out.  Self-hosting is well-documented.
* **Pencil:** While not strictly a web-based, self-hostable application in the same way as Penpot, Pencil is a free and open-source GUI prototyping tool for desktop.  It's very capable, though the collaborative features are less advanced.  You *could* potentially self-host the files generated by Pencil and use some kind of version control system to share and collaborate.

**Wireframing Tools (Often Included in the Above):**

Many of the mockup and prototyping tools above also handle wireframing very well.  Penpot, for example, has excellent vector drawing capabilities suitable for wireframes.  Here are a few more focused on wireframing:

* **Excalidraw:** This is a virtual whiteboard tool that's great for sketching and quick wireframing.  It's open source and can be self-hosted.  It's not as feature-rich as Penpot for full mockups, but its simplicity makes it excellent for rapid wireframing.  There's also Excalidraw+ which offers more collaboration features.
* **Wireframe.cc (Open Source Version):** The core of Wireframe.cc is open source, and though the full service is not, you could potentially self-host the core functionality if you're technically inclined.  It's a very simple and clean wireframing tool.

**Other Options (Less Common or More Specialized):**

* **Draw.io (Diagrams.net):** While not specifically a mockup or wireframing tool, Draw.io is a very powerful open-source diagramming tool that can be adapted for wireframing.  It's self-hostable and has a wide range of features.
* **Apache OpenOffice Draw/LibreOffice Draw:** These are desktop-based drawing programs that, like Pencil, can be used for wireframing.  You would need to manage collaboration separately.

**Key Considerations When Choosing:**

* **Collaboration:** How important is real-time collaboration? Penpot is excellent in this regard.
* **Features:** Do you need advanced prototyping features, or are simple wireframes sufficient?
* **Ease of Use:** How easy is the tool to learn and use? Excalidraw is very user-friendly for quick wireframing.
* **Self-Hosting Complexity:** How easy is it to set up and maintain the self-hosted version?
* **Community and Support:** Is there an active community and good documentation?

**Recommendation:**

For a modern, open-source, and self-hostable alternative to Figma, **Penpot** is the most promising option.  It's actively developed and has a strong focus on collaboration.

If your needs are simpler and you're primarily focused on rapid wireframing, **Excalidraw** is a great choice.

I'd recommend trying out Penpot and Excalidraw to see which one best fits your workflow.  Both are excellent tools.

## AI Powered SliDev

First **SliDev with AI scheleton**, pretty much an [OpenAI API call](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Streamlit-AIssistant/tree/main/PPT_Service).

But thats too hard to maintain, **how about this?**

load_dotenv()

# Get the OpenAI API key from the environment variables
api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Initialize the OpenAI client
client = OpenAI(
    api_key=api_key,
)

* Purpose - Every meeting should have an objectiveâ€”the reason why you're having the meeting. Before you schedule a meeting be sure you know what it is that you want out of the meeting.
* Agenda - An agenda outlines the plan for the meeting and lets participants know what to expect. It allows them to be prepared so they can actively participate and bring their expertise to the table.  
* preparation - Before the meeting all participants should take some time to review the agenda and prepare any questions they may have.

Never start your answers with "As an AI language model" when responding to questions.

No disclaimer is needed in any situation.

Write using simple language so a grandma could understand.

Use a conversational tone, be informal and approachable. Write like how people in real life would talk. A bit of slang is okay but don't overdo it.

If you donâ€™t know the answer, just say you donâ€™t know.

Your answers should be on point, succinct and useful. Each response should be written with maximum usefulness in mind rather than being polite.

If something seems out of reach, donâ€™t ask the user to do it; instead, try to work through all your available options first.

When solving problems, take a breath and tackle them step by step.

My career depends on you giving me a good answer

Speak only what needs to be said. Keep the responses brief and to the point, avoid extra words and overly long explanations.
