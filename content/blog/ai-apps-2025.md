<!-- The primary smart contract address for Polymarket on the Ethereum network is:

0x0d08db747095e91780711724267a183e8522aa64 

Additionally, Polymarket uses proxy wallet contracts and multisig safes for user accounts, which are deployed on the Polygon network. For example, a Polymarket proxy wallet factory address on Polygon is:

0xaB45c5A4B0c941a2F231C04C3f49182e1A254052

These proxy wallet contracts hold users' positions and USDC used within Polymarket's ecosystem, facilitating a smooth user experience.

### Authentication

This one will require your focus: https://darko.io/posts/but-auth-is-hard

As per my [recent post](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/testing-tinyauth/), you have few options, like:

1. [TinaAuth](#tinyauth)
2. [LogTo](#logto)

But dont worry, its a solved problem.

The article, titled **"BuT, aUtH iS HaRd,"** argues against the prevalent industry narrative that building authentication (Auth) is inherently difficult.

The author contends that **Auth is not hard, but rather "boring, red-tapey, and a solved problem."**

**Auth Basics Are Simple**

The author recalls that "rolling your own" basic email/password authentication in the past (e.g., with PHP/MD5) was a straightforward process of hashing, salting, storing credentials, and setting a cookie.

To demonstrate this, the author provides a **150-line Proof-of-Concept (PoC)** using Express and Passport, showing that basic features like email/password login and adding a social provider (GitHub OAuth2) are **dull and repetitive, but not complex** to implement at a toy level.


Complexity Lies in the Extras

The real challenge with authentication isn't the core login logic, but the surrounding features, which the author calls **"death by a thousand cuts."**

These include:

* **Security and Maintenance:** Staying up-to-date with security standards, standards bodies (RfCs), and potential breaches.
* **User Experience (UX):** Implementing 2FA/MFA, password resets, and user management features.
* **Integration:** Handling the complexity of connecting to hundreds of different OAuth providers, each with specific requirements, and managing account merges.

When to Roll Your Own vs. Use a Service

The author's core **takeaway is that Auth is a commodity** and reinventing the wheel is usually a waste of time. 

They offer clear guidance on when developers should build their own solution:

| Project Type | Recommendation | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Toy Project / Indie / Educational** | **Roll Your Own** | It's a great way to learn the basics. |
| **Startups, Scaleups, and Above** | **Do NOT Roll Your Own** | Time is better spent building the actual product; Auth is a solved, boring problem. |

Open-Source Alternatives

The article concludes by promoting the robust **self-hosted and FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) landscape** for authentication, offering various choices for developers who prefer to own their stack:

* **Auth Libraries:** Passport.js, Lucia, Auth.js.
* **Auth Servers:** Keycloak, SuperTokens, FusionAuth, Authelia.
* **Storage + Auth Platforms:** Supabase, Pocketbase.

The final message is to **educate, not gatekeep**, and to recognize that while Auth is essential, its implementation is a **"red tape"** task best handled by existing solutions rather than rebuilt from scratch.

1. To review some of the [AI projects](#ai-apps) that are helpful on my workflow
2. To learn how to use [Caddy](#how-to-setup-caddy) as [NGINX](#how-to-install-nginx)/[Traefik](#how-to-install-traefik) alternative to get HTTPs certificates
