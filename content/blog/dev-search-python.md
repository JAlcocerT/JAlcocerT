**Tl;DR**

This is not scrapping.

But programmatic live web search, like the [local deep researcher](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/live-search-and-research-with-ai/#local-deep-researcher) does with DDG.

**Intro**

I forked a project that was not only doing programatic web search, but also using agents.

Cool stuff.

But the DDG part I didnt have the change to play with.

## Web Search with Python

### Google

https://pypi.org/project/googlesearch-python/

### duckduckgo_search

You will see this one called DDG in many places.

And as we saw here, it does not require an API key (at least for now).

## Conclusions

There are even *programatic browsers*, like [Lynx](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/how-to-browse/#browsers-ive-tried):
