I got to know about NextJS for SSG purposes.

And themes like SaaSify can do the trick.

For SaaS, there are OSS starter kits like: https://github.com/nextacular/nextacular

https://nextacular.co/

https://docs.nextacular.co/

> MIT |  An open-source starter kit that will help you build full-stack multi-tenant SaaS platforms efficiently and help you focus on developing your core SaaS features. Built on top of popular and modern technologies such as Next JS, Tailwind, Prisma, and Stripe.

 ### Other F/OSS SSG's

This addition suggests other Static Site Generators (SSGs) that readers might find interesting based on their enjoyment of the Next.js post. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!

    HUGO: Lightning-fast speed.
    Astro: Built-in support for server-side rendering (SSR).
    Jekyll: Simplicity and ease of use, particularly for blogging.
    Gatsby: Rich ecosystem of plugins and a vibrant community.

If you have enjoyed the Next.js post, you might be interested to explore other SSGs like HUGO, Astro, Jekyll, and Gatsby. -->


<!-- - **Gatsby**: Gatsby is a popular static site generator within the **React** ecosystem, leveraging React for building static sites and offering a rich plugin ecosystem.
  - **Pros**:
    - Ability to pull data from various sources, including CMSs and APIs.
    - React-based, enabling component-based development and rich interactivity.
    - Extensive plugin ecosystem for adding functionality and integrating with third-party services.
  - **Cons**:
    - Longer build times for large projects due to complex data fetching and processing.
    - Steeper learning curve for developers unfamiliar with React.
    - Requires a Node.js environment for development and building.

- **Next.js**: Next.js is primarily known as a **React** framework for SSR and CSR, but it also offers SSG capabilities, providing flexibility for different project needs.
  - **Pros**:
    - Versatility to choose between SSR, CSR, or SSG based on project requirements.
    - Seamless integration with React for building dynamic user interfaces.
    - Hybrid capabilities for blending static and dynamic content in a single application.
  - **Cons**:
