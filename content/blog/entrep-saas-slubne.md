**Tl;DR**

MVP first - *Tomate fuco y a toma pcul0*

Get those eyes going via ads towards: `https://www.slubnechwile.com/`

See what works and what not - PMF (?) :)


**Intro**

For **green field AI vibe coding** has been great, for brown field...not that much.

Despite the project docs with AI was interesting

Thats why I want to put together some boilerplates that just get the work done.

And...ship sth already this year.

The main pieces are clear already as per:

* **S vs D:**
  * Supply - ~ infinite (∞), scalable via [Serverless storage](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/docs/dev/serverless/#cloudflare-r2).
  * Demand - constrained, ad driven

![Supply and Demand for a SaaS](/blog_img/entrepre/bip-supply-demand.png)

With a very clear: Online marketing and an online delivery

**Type of offer**: attraction ~~/ upsale / downsale / continuity~~ *that's how the landing should be presented, later will be other offers*

  {{< card link="https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/docs/dev/serverless/" title="Serverless | Docs ↗" icon="book-open" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

The **tech stack**:

| Requirement | Specification | Clarification / Decision |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend Framework** | Astro | |
| **Styling/UI Library** | Sassify MIT like theme | |
| **[Backend](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/docs/dev/fe-vs-be/)** | | |
| **Database** | FireStore | |
| **[Authentication](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/docs/dev/authentication/)** | Firebase Auth | |
| **E-mail/ESP** | MailTrap | |
| **Analytics** | Posthog | |
| **Hosting** | Container | |


{{< details title="Choosing an UI tech stack 📌" closed="true" >}}

* HUGO: Lightning-fast speed.
* Astro: Built-in support for server-side rendering (SSR).
* Jekyll: Simplicity and ease of use, particularly for blogging.
* Gatsby: Rich ecosystem of plugins and a vibrant community.

**Gatsby**: Gatsby is a popular static site generator within the **React** ecosystem, leveraging React for building static sites and offering a rich plugin ecosystem.

- **Pros**:
  - Ability to pull data from various sources, including CMSs and APIs.
  - React-based, enabling component-based development and rich interactivity.
  - Extensive plugin ecosystem for adding functionality and integrating with third-party services.
- **Cons**:
  - Longer build times for large projects due to complex data fetching and processing.
  - Steeper learning curve for developers unfamiliar with React.
  - Requires a Node.js environment for development and building.

- **Next.js**: Next.js is primarily known as a **React** framework for SSR and CSR, but it also offers SSG capabilities, providing flexibility for different project needs.

- **Pros**:
  - Versatility to choose between SSR, CSR, or SSG based on project requirements.
  - Seamless integration with React for building dynamic user interfaces.
  - Hybrid capabilities for blending static and dynamic content in a single application.
- **Cons**:
  - Complex configuration compared to simpler static site generators.
  - Requires familiarity with React and Node.js for effective usage.
  - Limited built-in features compared to dedicated static site generators like Hugo.

## Getting Here

This has been...a series of *random* steps.

```sh
#dig slubnechwile.com any
#ping slubnechwile.com
#curl https://slubnechwile.com/sitemap-index0.xml
whois slubnechwile.com | grep -i -E "(creation|created|registered)"

git clone https://github.com/JAlcocerT/slubnechwile
```

```sh
git init && git add . && git commit -m "Initial commit: starting for google ads" && gh repo create slubne-chwile-y26 --private --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

And it goes like: *hey antigravity...and Claude 4.5 Opus*

```md
can you have a look to the z-brd, z-frd  z-prd and z-user-flow documents and let me know if the requirement and end goal of the project is clear?

wherever you see gap, lets clarify them into a z-clarifications.md document, where i will provide direction

```

And remember that you can prefix the email that has paid by doing [like so](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/flask-cms-for-ssgs/#a-cms-with-flask).

For your launch phase with a low daily budget, you should **optimize for Sign-ups** (Account Creation) rather than Purchases.

The ad algorithm needs to learn and also you need to learn with PostHog what are the frictions points.

### Tinkered with Selfhosting

Like...a lot.

### Discovered one for weddings

I tested [wedding share](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/software-for-weddings/#weddingshare-setup)...and it looked cool.

People liked it.

All of this happened [while travelling](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/tech-for-a-trip/).

Yea, I took the laptop :)

### Also Saw Cool Themes

* https://github.com/jacoknapp/EternalVows

> Lightweight wedding website that you host | Configurable via yaml!

I got to know about NextJS for SSG purposes.

And themes like SaaSify can do the trick.

### DFY for a close one

But they needed something simpler.

So i made a filebrowser + custom QR setup.

How could I not tinker with QR for the sake of it...

With Python:

[![Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JAlcocerT/JAlcocerT/blob/main/Z_TestingLanguages/Z_Python/QR_generation.ipynb)


And with node:

![QR Code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JAlcocerT/Home-Lab/main/py-static/qr-pdf/qr-sample.png)

Even with a [SliDev VUE Components like this one](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/slidev-editor/blob/logtojseauth/slidev/slidev-ba-tech-talk-mermaid-exadel/components/QRCode.vue) you can generate QRs!


Not all the content is indexed in the same way across engines and you can miss valuable info.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Thanks to Ecosia** I could find how to add Web Analytics to the [Jekyll Chirpy Theme](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/raspberrypi-starting-guide/)!

<!-- https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Home-Lab/blob/main/py-static/qr-pdf/qr-sample.png -->

### Tinkered with Serverless

And i dont mean static deploy to cloudflare pages this time.

I mean about serverless s3 storage, via **cf R2**.

Which i got familiar with on [this post](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/hugo-pocketbase-and-r2/).


![alt text](/blog_img/dev/cf/r2.png)

Exactly, the [nextjs-r2 project repo](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/nextjs-r2-demo) show me sth: *there is life beyond filebrowser*

```sh
# Cloudflare R2 Configuration

#get this one from the Workers and Pages section!
ACCOUNT_ID=abcdef123456

# Required for Pre-signed URLs and Temporary Credentials methods
# Get these from: R2 → Manage R2 API tokens → Account API Tokens → Create API token
ACCESS_KEY_ID=
SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=

# R2 Bucket Name
# The name of your R2 bucket (e.g., my-nextjs-demo-bucket)
BUCKET_NAME=my-nextjs-demo-bucket

# Required ONLY for Temporary Credentials method
# Get this from: My Profile → API Tokens → Create Token
# Permissions needed: Account - Workers R2 Storage:Edit, User - API Tokens:Edit
AUTH_TOKEN=

# Note: Workers API method doesn't use these environment variables
# It uses R2 bindings configured in wrangler.toml instead
```

And also: *serverless auth via firebase auth*

```sh
npm install stripe firebase-admin
```

### And ... more websites

Not just the latest [DIY Landing boilerplate](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/diy-landing-boilerplate)

Themes:  <https://vercel.com/templates>

### Emails too, ofc

I made an [email APIs 101 here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/emails-101/#conclusions).

Also, leveraged with the [make landing](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/make-landing) project at [this post](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/diy-landing-boilerplate/#combined-email-capture-with-programmatic-emails).

[![Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JAlcocerT/make-landing/blob/main/mailetrap-esp.ipynb)


You might be interested to see `https://proton.me/support/catch-all` for your support email [with a discount](https://pr.tn/ref/RHJ7YZE8).

```md
If you are planning to use this domain with Proton Mail, note that weʼll only accept email for enabled addresses with encryption keys.
```

[You might reveal that](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/selling-with-a-landing-website/#outro) a business email and privacy for ~70$/y is not that important for you as you say it is.

### Chatting with Gemini about the offer


{{% details title="ADS + BANT 🚀" closed="true" %}}

That is the ultimate, high-level business question.

Your entire flow is strategically built to identify, filter, and cater to the four key elements of a qualified lead—**Budget, Authority, Need, and Timing (BANT)**—which is especially important when using paid advertising.

Here is how the *Ślubne Chwile* flow addresses and converts leads based on BANT criteria:

🎯 Matching the Flow to the BANT Sales Criteria

1. **Need (The Problem Solver)**

* **Definition:** Does the prospect have a legitimate problem that your service solves? (Losing guest photos/videos).
* **Flow Mechanism:**
    * **Landing Page:** The Hero Section and the Benefits Section (Section 2) are entirely dedicated to establishing need. The headlines explicitly state the problem ("Nie Strać Żadnej Uśmiechniętej Chwili") and offer the solution.
    * **Free Test:** Allowing them to upload 5 photos and see the Admin Panel validates the need for collection and organization.
* **Verdict:** **Need is established upon Landing Page conversion.** If they register, they confirm they have this problem.

2. **Timing (The Time-Driven Nudge)**

* **Definition:** When does the prospect need the solution? (Tied to the wedding date).
* **Flow Mechanism:**
    * **Registration:** **Collecting the Wedding Date** is the single most critical piece of BANT data. It allows you to schedule the rest of the sales process.
    * **Email Nurturing:** Emails are scheduled to peak **3–4 months before the wedding**—the ideal time when couples are finalizing vendor lists and security details.
    * **Paid Duration:** Tiers are based on post-wedding access (1, 3, or 12 months), making the time/urgency a central conversion factor.
* **Verdict:** **Timing is acquired at registration (A4) and utilized throughout the sales cycle (Z2).**

3. **Authority (The Decision Maker)**

* **Definition:** Is this the person who can make the purchase decision? (The Bride and Groom).
* **Flow Mechanism:**
    * **Registration:** Requiring **both the Bride's and Groom's names** (A4) explicitly targets the decision-makers. The personalization is immediately linked to their names (e.g., `slubnechwile.pl/Anna-i-Jan`), confirming they have the authority to act.
    * **Password Security:** The **"Set Guest Password"** feature (Z4) is a core control function that only the Authority would care about, forcing their attention to the paywall.
* **Verdict:** **Authority is verified by the commitment to the customized link (A7).**

4. **Budget (The Price/Value Match)**

* **Definition:** Can the prospect afford your service, and do they agree with the value?
* **Flow Mechanism:**
    * **Tiered Pricing (E):** The three tiers address different budgets:
        * **Bronze (149 PLN):** Caters to the lowest budget (anchor).
        * **Silver (299 PLN):** Targets the average, high-profit budget (most popular).
        * **Premium (699 PLN):** Targets the high-value, risk-averse budget (high AOV).
    * **Feature Stacking:** The Silver and Premium features (**Live Preview, Pre-Wedding Memories, 12-Month Access**) are carefully stacked to provide disproportionately higher value than the simple price difference, forcing the customer to **choose based on value, not just cost.**
* **Verdict:** **Budget is addressed at the point of conversion (Z5) after Need, Timing, and Authority have been established, making the pricing easier to accept.**

{{% /details %}}

The entire *Ślubne Chwile* flow is designed as a **BANT qualification machine**.

It uses free access to gather the necessary data (Need, Timing, Authority) before presenting the Budget

Ensuring that by the time a couple sees the price, they are already highly qualified, emotionally invested, and ready to convert.

## Conclusions

Is it a new product that needs evangelization? 

No, there is demand already :)

Whats working and whats not?

Is the product not working? wrong seller? wrong avatar/target audience/client?

It has been all about building around [the BANT idea](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/wedding-photo-galleries/#the-lead-magnet).

Show the products ads for those that apply.

They get the free thing / trial and we are happy to get your feedback :)

### Setting Up Google ads

This has been a thing: `https://ads.google.com` and `https://tagassistant.google.com/`

You will need terms, privacy policy and contact: `https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6368661?hl=en#673`

Anda support mail.

But...hey, they take you by the hand and make your on boarding very simple.

Admire how much resources they can provide you, just so that you place that CC details for them.

![Slubne Chwile google ads](/blog_img/biz/gads/google-ads.png)

The CX customer experience was impressive.

Keywords: `weddings`

Budget: whatever per month

Pros say to keep getting better at this until you spend successfully 6k$/month

1/2/8 pln click (cost per click) depending on competition.

![alt text](/blog_img/biz/gads/campaing-goals.png)

```js
gtag('event', 'conversion', {
                  'send_to': 'AW-',
                  'value': 1.0,
                  'currency': 'PLN',
                  'transaction_id': ''
```

### Random Things I Got to know

1. Google uses salesforce $CRM and also `https://www.qualtrics.com/` for feedback
2. Maybe having an optimized video sales on the landing, like this one: `https://thebigschool.com/master-ia/` 
3. Also...the whatsapp bouble for signups people?
