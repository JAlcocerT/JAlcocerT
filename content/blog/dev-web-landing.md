**Using KeyStatic CMS** with Mizar Astro Theme

Once you install and run the dev server:

```sh
npm install
#rm -rf .git
npm run dev
```

You will see the regular `localhost:4321` to explore the theme

But also: `http://127.0.0.1:4321/keystatic/` is available.

```sh
npm run build
npx serve -s dist #http://localhost:3000
```
