Astro Themes for inspiration on **Landing Pages**:

1. AstroZinc - https://astrozinc.exylons.com/

2. Luna Landing - https://github.com/JimmyCamus/luna-landing

* **Configurable** with a JSON!
* **MIT** | Template of a business landing page to be configured by json file `/src/data/landing.json`

{{< details title="Proposed for Ourika ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

* The fav icons works as configured with `"./public/favicon.svg"`

Which I could change *from png to svg* thanks to [adobe](https://www.adobe.com/express/feature/image/convert/png-to-svg) and provided `guideventure-logo.svg`

* The theme brings an **OG Image**, which equals to the first image of the landing.
* PagesSpeed: 100/100/100/100

> Compared with the competitor (WP) ~ping 30 vs ping ~300

* With [Cal.com](https://refer.cal.com/jalcocertech)


I needed to make few tweaks for the images to work (when they are at `public`)

```sh
sudo apt install webp

for file in *.jpg; do
  cwebp "$file" -o "${file%.jpg}.webp"
done
```

```sh
sudo apt install graphicsmagick-imagemagick-compat
convert tour1.webp -rotate 180 tour1_rotated.webp
```

## Conclusion

That was a one time setup, but one directional.

Im also exploring how these kind of themes do it so that it incorporates a KeystaticCMS:

## FAQ

**What it is KeyStaticCMS?**

A tool that makes Markdown, JSON and YAML content in your codebase editable by humans.

Live edit content *on GitHub or your local file system*, without disrupting your existing code and workflows.

**Using KeyStatic CMS** with Mizar Astro Theme

Once you install and run the dev server:

```sh
npm install
#rm -rf .git
npm run dev
```

You will see the regular `localhost:4321` to explore the theme

But also: `http://127.0.0.1:4321/keystatic/` is available.

```sh
npm run build
npx serve -s dist #http://localhost:3000
```
