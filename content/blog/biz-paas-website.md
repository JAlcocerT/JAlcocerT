Recently I was doing some [IT setup for weddings](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/software-for-weddings/).

And couple of [Wordpress](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/no-code-websites/).

Its not taking much if you have the know how already...

but still, there is a manual process to spin containers, add https with the Proxy Manager...

Then I found **[these F/OSS PaaS software](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/deploying-software-with-paas-to-servers/)**.

## Selfhostable PaaS

### DokPloy

Dokploy Cloud is a platform that enables users to **deploy containerized applications** and databases with ease. 

The platform provides all the necessary tools for building, deploying, and managing applications, making it an attractive option for developers.

* https://github.com/Dokploy/dokploy
  * https://dokploy.com/
  * https://docs.dokploy.com/docs/core
  * https://docs.dokploy.com/docs/core/docker-compose/example

> Apache v2 | Open Source **Alternative to Vercel, Netlify and Heroku**.

```sh
curl -sSL https://dokploy.com/install.sh | sh #will need ~300mb to get started
```

> This automatically spins: Dokploy + PostgreSQL + Redis + Traefik


You will authorize dokploy as Github App: https://github.com/apps/dokploy-jesalctag

With Dokploty we can for example, **serve an Astro site, or any other containerized app**

* DokPloy Astro Example from their docs
* Or...the Streamlt MultiChat: *we are just pointing to [this file](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Streamlit-MultiChat/blob/main/Z_DeployMe/Docker-Compose.yml) `./Z_DeployMe/Docker-Compose.yml`*

**What do I like about DokPloy?**

1. Simple setup: Connect to you github repositories and start deploying

![alt text](/blog_img/selfh/PaaS/dokploy-github-app.png)

> This is quite handy if you have [collected a lot of docker-compose](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Docker/) files for quick deployments

*See for example how to deploy [RStocks](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/R_Stocks)*

2. Traefik HTTPs built in

![alt text](/blog_img/selfh/PaaS/dockploy-https.png)

Also for the services:

3. Dokploy brings a monitoring section to see how much each app consumes

![alt text](/blog_img/selfh/PaaS/dokploy-monitoring-multichat.png)

4. You can invite and manage what other users/members can do with your Dokploy server

### Scaling Wordpress and Ghost

Thanks to Dokploy, you can invite some user and give the possibility to spin Wordpress and Ghost services.

1. Ghost Deployment with DokPloy
