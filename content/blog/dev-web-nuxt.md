New year, time to **try out some new SSG**.

This time it is the turn of **Nuxt**

* https://github.com/HugoRCD/canvas

1. the first thing I noticed, it takes much more time to load compared to Astro or NextJS sites, and much more than HUGO.

You just need **2 things**: NPM and NodeJS.

* https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
* https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager


{{< details title="Setup Node and NPM - x86/ARM64/ARM32 üìå" closed="true" >}}

```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

#install NodeJS https://deb.nodesource.com/
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Verify installation
node -v   # Should show Node.js version - 20.18.1
npm -v    # Should show npm version - 10.8.2
```

{{< /details >}}

Now you can spin a server and make **ASTRO [Remote Development](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/blog/dev-in-docker)** in it.


## Moto Blogger Setup

The **theme** - https://github.com/JAlcocerT/horizon

## A SSG Recap

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Im assuming that you are already aware [about CSS](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/blog/dev-css/) and [JS tricks](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/javascript-for-static-websites)
{{< /callout >}}

Most SSGs will be powered by node.

Certainly! Below is an improved version of the table that provides a comparison of **Hugo**, **Astro**, **Next.js**, **Jekyll**, **Gatsby**, and **Nuxt**. It highlights key aspects of each static site generator or framework.

<!-- [![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=gohugoio/hugo&type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#gohugoio/hugo&Date) -->


For **HUGO** you will need to use GO, as explained [here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/using-hugo-as-website/).


For **Jekyll**, you will need Ruby.

If you plan to use [Github Pages with these SSGs](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/how-to-use-github-pages/), create the proper **[Github Actions](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/github-actions-use-cases) workflow**.

1. Find the Theme Source Code

Github is a good starting point.

You can **take components ideas**, like: `::github{repo="saicaca/fuwari"}`

2. Clone The Theme

Make sure you are free to use the theme as per its License and then **clone it**:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Ruben-Winant/astro_spark_template ./astro_template #it has a cool carousel!
cd ./astro_template
rm -rf .git #remove existing git
```

3. Try the Theme

```sh
npm run build
npm run dev
```

    {{< filetree/file name="_index.md" >}}
    {{< filetree/folder name="docs" state="closed" >}}
      {{< filetree/file name="_index.md" >}}

Astro Themes I find interesting:

1. Fuwari
2. VisVRS ()
3. AstroWind (which uses [Tailwind CSS](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/blog/dev-css/#competitors-to-tailwind-css))

### Adding addsense

Including the Google AdSense script in the <head> of every page generated by Hugo is straightforward. 

1. Step 1: Locate Your **Header** Template

In A **Hugo** site's directory, navigate to the layouts folder: `themes/PaperMod/layouts/partials/head.html`

Find the partial template responsible for the <head> section of your pages.

This is commonly located in `layouts/partials` and might be named head.html or similar.

If you use **astro**, they are normally at `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`

You will **add something like this script**:

```html
<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-1234567890"
     crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
``` 

https://www.google.com/adsense/new/u/0/pub-1816803660718163/home
https://www.google.com/adsense/new/u/0/pub-1816803660718163/privacymessaging

You also need to get the `ads.txt` (get it here https://www.google.com/adsense/new/u/0/pub-1816803660718163/sites/detail/url=yourwebsite.com)

to the root directory, for example in `/public`, with info similar to:

```txt
google.com, pub-123456789, DIRECT, abcd124fgthrk9876
```

## FAQ

    SSG (Static Site Generation):
    Static Site Generation involves generating HTML pages at build time, typically using a site generator or build tool. The generated HTML pages contain all the necessary content and assets, and they are served to clients as-is without the need for server-side processing. This approach offers benefits such as fast loading times, security, and scalability. Popular static site generators include Gatsby, Next.js (with static site generation), Jekyll, and Hugo.

    SSR (Server-Side Rendering):
    Server-Side Rendering involves generating HTML pages dynamically on the server in response to each client request. With SSR, the server processes the request, renders the page with the necessary data, and sends the fully rendered HTML to the client's browser. SSR is commonly used in web applications built with frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt.js, and Angular Universal. SSR can offer benefits such as improved SEO, faster initial page loads, and better support for dynamic content.

    ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration):
    Incremental Static Regeneration is a hybrid approach that combines the benefits of static site generation and dynamic content updates. With ISR, pages are initially generated statically at build time, but they can also be updated dynamically in the background. When a user requests a page that has been updated since the last build, the server regenerates the page with fresh data and serves the updated version. ISR is a feature available in frameworks like Next.js, enabling developers to pre-render dynamic content while still benefiting from static site performance.

In summary, SSG generates HTML pages at build time, SSR generates HTML pages dynamically on the server in response to requests, and ISR combines static site generation with dynamic content updates for improved performance and flexibility. Each approach has its strengths and use cases, and the choice depends on the specific requirements of the project. -->

Next.js in 100 Seconds // Plus Full Beginner's Tutorial
Overview

Welcome to our report on the video "Next.js in 100 Seconds // Plus Full Beginner's Tutorial" by Fireship. In this report, we'll delve into the world of Next.js, a React-based framework for building fast and scalable web applications. If you're new to Next.js or looking to improve your skills, this report is a must-read.
What is Next.js?

Next.js is a popular framework for building server-rendered, statically generated, and performance-optimized React applications. It allows developers to create fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly web apps with zero configuration. In traditional React apps, content is rendered on the client-side, which can lead to slow page loads and poor SEO. Next.js solves this problem by rendering content on the server, providing a better user experience and search engine optimization.
Features of Next.js

Next.js provides several features that make it an ideal choice for building modern web applications. Some of these features include:

    Server-side rendering: Next.js allows you to render content on the server, providing a faster and more SEO-friendly experience.
    Static site generation: Next.js can pre-render pages at build time, making it ideal for blogs and applications with infrequently changing data.
    Incremental static regeneration: Next.js can also regenerate pages dynamically, allowing for flexibility in data updating.
    API routes: Next.js provides a way to create server-only API routes, which can be useful for tasks that require server-side processing.

Building a Next.js App

To get started with Next.js, you can create a new project using the npx create-next-app command. This will set up a basic Next.js project with a pages directory, where you can define your application's routes.

In the pages directory, you can create separate files for each route, which will export a default React component. Next.js will then use these components to render the application.
Data Fetching in Next.js

Next.js provides several strategies for fetching data, including:

    getStaticProps: This function allows you to fetch data at build time and pre-render pages.
    getServerSideProps: This function allows you to fetch data on each request and render pages dynamically.

Conclusion

In conclusion, Next.js is a powerful framework for building fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly web applications. With its features, such as server-side rendering, static site generation, and data fetching strategies, Next.js provides a robust set of tools for building modern web applications.
