## About Engine Balance

<!-- 
video insights
can you summarize this video? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS48jX68YU&t=82s
Then provide a summary and pros and cons of the balance of each engine type discussed

The video titled "ENGINE BALANCE: Inline 6 vs. V6 vs. VR6 vs. Flat / Boxer 6" discusses the engine balance, strengths, and weaknesses of four popular six-cylinder engine configurations: the inline six, the V6, the VR6, and the flat six.

Here are the summaries and pros and cons of each engine type discussed:

Inline 6: This engine configuration is simple and balanced. It only needs one cylinder head, one or two cams, and one exhaust manifold. However, its length is a downside as it's difficult to fit transversely in an engine bay. It's hard to fault the inline six other than its length.

Pros: Simple design, beautifully balanced, even firing interval.
Cons: Its length makes it difficult to fit in some engine bays.
V6: The V6 was created to address the length issue of the inline six. It's shorter and easier to fit transversely in an engine bay. However, it loses the inherent primary balance of the inline six and needs engineering aids like balancing shafts or crankshaft counterweights to achieve smoothness.

Pros: Compact design, easier to fit in engine bays.
Cons: Loses inherent primary balance of inline six, needs engineering aids for smoothness, more complex with double the number of cylinder heads, cams, and exhaust manifolds compared to inline six.
VR6: The VR6 is essentially a V6 but with an extremely narrow angle between the banks. It's compact like a V6 but without the double cylinder heads, cams, exhaust manifolds, and other components, while preserving the inherent balanced nature of the inline six.

Pros: Compact, better balanced than a generic V6, simpler than a V6.
Cons: Not as simple as an inline six, needs slanted pistons and additional crankshaft counterweights, differences in length between intake and exhaust ports can result in different power and torque curves.
Flat / Boxer 6: The flat six, or more accurately a boxer six, is perfectly balanced and has a very short and light crankshaft. However, it's the most complex engine configuration of all four discussed and is difficult to package due to its width.

Pros: Perfectly balanced, light crankshaft, rev-happy engine.
Cons: Most complex engine configuration, difficult to package due to its width, most expensive and complex engine to manufacture.
In conclusion, each engine type has its own strengths and weaknesses. The inline six is simple and balanced but long, the V6 is compact but less balanced, the VR6 is a compact and simpler version of a V6 but not as simple as an inline six, and the flat/boxer six is perfectly balanced and light but complex and wide. -->
