**Tl;DR**

You should probably know the WHY you are going somewhere first.

This will just reply to the where/how.


**Intro**

Following the TripPlanner, I thought that bringing cost of living data was a good idea.

For the cost of living data, we can take online info...

Because weather and cost is all that matter, right?

AI search engine with web, news, and images. You will need firecrawl and groq Apis.
