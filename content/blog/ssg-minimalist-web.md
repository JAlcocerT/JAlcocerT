**Tl;DR**

The minimalist web vs the independent web

**Intro**

Do we need that much bloat?

Probably not.

What we probably need is a **Minimalist Webs** where different opinions can coexist.

I really enjoy finding blogs around that are not just a copy paste from the previous one.

Specially if they bring a phogo gallery like [this one](https://brianli.com/photos/)

But some people take it one level higher and do webs veeery minimalistic.

## Conclusions

It curious to see how 'old designs' like: https://1999.37signals.com/

Are very easy to read, kind of a book!

Despite not been as minimalistic as the sites above, I really enjoy hugo/astro and static site hosting to publish.

There is not a single time that Ive opened: https://astro.build/themes/1/?search=&price%5B%5D=free and havent found sth interesting.

Whatever you build, make sure to **validate the outcome**:

### Better Docs

I was considering Astro starlight for a documentation theme with i18n support here.

And doubting if sth like [HUGO congo](https://github.com/jpanther/Congo) would be the way forward.

But then I found this: https://github.com/themefisher/dockit-astro


```sh
git clone https://github.com/JAlcocerT/dockit-astro
#make install && make dev
```

> This is simple great for F/OSS 

Time for a: Whats working, whats not and whats next?

Well, Google also released https://codewiki.google/ which can potentially get outdated my manual/windsurf/codex way of writing technical docs.

Time well tell.

For now it ,just' works on certain popular repos: https://codewiki.google/github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli

But what Im sure is that the brand needs an upgrade from blog like to doc+blog like.

Anyways, wherever that might go, I have learnt a lot with it.

And I can see that some people have created couple of brands around them:

* https://flaviocopes.com/count-visits-static-site/
  * https://thevalleyofcode.com/ - THis is basically a doc like website...that reads like a web ebook. Cool idea!
* Even [courses](https://flaviocopes.com/courses/)/ebooks with distilled knowledge: https://flaviocopes.com/access/


### Better Blogs

Im already looking for 2026.

And in there i will keep tinkering on this medium.

But the curated already digested content will go to `blog.jalcocertech.com`

1. https://github.com/ricocc/ricoui-portfolio

2. Monakit, which I tinkered superficially [here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/selfhosted-apps-sept-2025/#lately-i) - I liked the ppt integration out of the box

3. https://github.com/nuxt-ui-templates/portfolio/tree/main which is a cool NUXT Theme similar to [Canvas](https://github.com/HugoRCD/canvas)

>  Nuxt Portfolio Template made with Nuxt UI and [Nuxt Content](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Home-Lab/tree/main/nuxt-content). 

4. https://github.com/konstantinmuenster/gatsby-theme-portfolio-minimal Now that I have covered gatsby?

## FAQ

    SSG (Static Site Generation):
    Static Site Generation involves generating HTML pages at build time, typically using a site generator or build tool. The generated HTML pages contain all the necessary content and assets, and they are served to clients as-is without the need for server-side processing. This approach offers benefits such as fast loading times, security, and scalability. Popular static site generators include Gatsby, Next.js (with static site generation), Jekyll, and Hugo.

    SSR (Server-Side Rendering):
    Server-Side Rendering involves generating HTML pages dynamically on the server in response to each client request. With SSR, the server processes the request, renders the page with the necessary data, and sends the fully rendered HTML to the client's browser. SSR is commonly used in web applications built with frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt.js, and Angular Universal. SSR can offer benefits such as improved SEO, faster initial page loads, and better support for dynamic content.

    ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration):
    Incremental Static Regeneration is a hybrid approach that combines the benefits of static site generation and dynamic content updates. With ISR, pages are initially generated statically at build time, but they can also be updated dynamically in the background. When a user requests a page that has been updated since the last build, the server regenerates the page with fresh data and serves the updated version. ISR is a feature available in frameworks like Next.js, enabling developers to pre-render dynamic content while still benefiting from static site performance.

In summary, SSG generates HTML pages at build time, SSR generates HTML pages dynamically on the server in response to requests, and ISR combines static site generation with dynamic content updates for improved performance and flexibility. Each approach has its strengths and use cases, and the choice depends on the specific requirements of the project. -->

Next.js in 100 Seconds // Plus Full Beginner's Tutorial
Overview

Welcome to our report on the video "Next.js in 100 Seconds // Plus Full Beginner's Tutorial" by Fireship. In this report, we'll delve into the world of Next.js, a React-based framework for building fast and scalable web applications. If you're new to Next.js or looking to improve your skills, this report is a must-read.
What is Next.js?

Next.js is a popular framework for building server-rendered, statically generated, and performance-optimized React applications. It allows developers to create fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly web apps with zero configuration. In traditional React apps, content is rendered on the client-side, which can lead to slow page loads and poor SEO. Next.js solves this problem by rendering content on the server, providing a better user experience and search engine optimization.
Features of Next.js

Next.js provides several features that make it an ideal choice for building modern web applications. Some of these features include:

    Server-side rendering: Next.js allows you to render content on the server, providing a faster and more SEO-friendly experience.
    Static site generation: Next.js can pre-render pages at build time, making it ideal for blogs and applications with infrequently changing data.
    Incremental static regeneration: Next.js can also regenerate pages dynamically, allowing for flexibility in data updating.
    API routes: Next.js provides a way to create server-only API routes, which can be useful for tasks that require server-side processing.

Building a Next.js App

To get started with Next.js, you can create a new project using the npx create-next-app command. This will set up a basic Next.js project with a pages directory, where you can define your application's routes.

In the pages directory, you can create separate files for each route, which will export a default React component. Next.js will then use these components to render the application.
Data Fetching in Next.js

Next.js provides several strategies for fetching data, including:

    getStaticProps: This function allows you to fetch data at build time and pre-render pages.
    getServerSideProps: This function allows you to fetch data on each request and render pages dynamically.

Conclusion

In conclusion, Next.js is a powerful framework for building fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly web applications. With its features, such as server-side rendering, static site generation, and data fetching strategies, Next.js provides a robust set of tools for building modern web applications.
Takeaways

    Next.js is a React-based framework for building fast and scalable web applications.
    Next.js provides server-side rendering, static site generation, and incremental static regeneration.
    Next.js has built-in support for API routes and data fetching strategies.
