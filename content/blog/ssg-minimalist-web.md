**Tl;DR**


**Intro**

Do we need that much bloat?

Probably not.

What we probably need is a **Minimalist Webs** where different opinions can coexist.

I really enjoy finding blogs around that are not just a copy paste from the previous one.

Specially if they bring a phogo gallery like [this one](https://brianli.com/photos/)

But some people take it one level higher and do webs veeery minimalistic.

## Conclusions


Despite not been as minimalistic as the sites above, I really enjoy hugo/astro and static site hosting to publish.

There is not a single time that Ive opened: https://astro.build/themes/1/?search=&price%5B%5D=free and havent found sth interesting.

Whatever you build, make sure to validate:


{{< hextra/feature-grid >}}
 
{{< hextra/feature-card
  title="Google Speed Test"
  subtitle="Test the speed and performance with PageSpeed Insights."
  style="background: radial-gradient(ellipse at 50% 80%,rgba(221,210,59,0.15),hsla(0,0%,100%,0));"
  link="https://pagespeed.web.dev/"
>}}

{{< hextra/feature-card
  title="Website Carbon"
  subtitle="Website’s carbon footprint and environmental impact."
  style="background: radial-gradient(ellipse at 50% 80%,rgba(142,53,74,0.15),hsla(0,0%,50%,0));"

### Better Docs

I was considering Astro starlight for a documentation theme with i18n support here.

And doubting if sth like [HUGO congo](https://github.com/jpanther/Congo) would be the way forward.

But then I found this: https://github.com/themefisher/dockit-astro

https://github.com/JAlcocerT/dockit-astro

> This is simple great for F/OSS 

Time for a: Whats working, whats not and whats next?

Well, Google also released https://codewiki.google/ which can potentially get outdated my manual/windsurf/codex way of writing technical docs.

Time well tell.

For now it ,just' works on certain popular repos: https://codewiki.google/github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli

But what Im sure is that the brand needs an upgrade from blog like to doc+blog like.

Anyways, wherever that might go, I have learnt a lot with it.

And I can see that some people have created couple of brands around them:

* https://flaviocopes.com/count-visits-static-site/
  * https://thevalleyofcode.com/ - THis is basically a doc like website...that reads like a web ebook. Cool idea!
* Even [courses](https://flaviocopes.com/courses/)/ebooks with distilled knowledge: https://flaviocopes.com/access/


### Better Blogs

Im already looking for 2026.

And in there i will keep tinkering on this medium.

But the curated already digested content will go to `blog.jalcocertech.com`

1. https://github.com/ricocc/ricoui-portfolio

2. Monakit, which I tinkered superficially [here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/selfhosted-apps-sept-2025/#lately-i) - I liked the ppt integration out of the box

3. https://github.com/nuxt-ui-templates/portfolio/tree/main which is a cool NUXT Theme similar to [Canvas](https://github.com/HugoRCD/canvas)

>  Nuxt Portfolio Template made with Nuxt UI and [Nuxt Content](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Home-Lab/tree/main/nuxt-content). 

4. https://github.com/konstantinmuenster/gatsby-theme-portfolio-minimal Now that I have covered gatsby?


### CMS x Astro

From the experience: Dont do more than 3 websites to very close people if you they are not able to self-server.

Thats where [selfhosted tools](https://docs.vrite.io/self-hosting/configuration/) like: https://github.com/vriteio/vrite are supposed to shine.

I also got inspired by tools listed: https://www.awesome-homelab.com/category/writing
