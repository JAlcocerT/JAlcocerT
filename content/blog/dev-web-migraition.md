It's always great to having a look to the initial pages to know what to expect from them.


{{< details title="Checking that a Website works - or in this case, what we will have to Migrate ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

* WebCheck - 
* Gte all url/pages of a website - A must to migrate everything!
* Are there any broken links?

I was expecting to just use the latest [AI Scrapping tools that I learnt here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/scrap-and-chat-with-the-web/)...

...but **Python+BS4** can do very interesting tricks.

It was very helpful to have thes [Scraping Tools Repo](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Scrap_Tools) and to have [this related post](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/scrap-and-chat-with-the-web/) ðŸ’»

Lets have a look.


## For the Real Estate Project

{{< details title="Getting All the Images from the Web to Migrate [BS4] ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

You can do the following:

1. explore the website content
2. find the html section where all the photo links are stored
3. Use LLMs so that they give you a Python Code to: Find the photo links + Download them in a folder
4. Repeat for every link you have (leverage the previous functions)
5. [Optional] Include the folder to the `.gitignore`
