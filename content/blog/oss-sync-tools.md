I was confortable so far thinking that it was all about Nextcloud and Syncthing.

But lets have a closer look, as ftp and webdavs can also make the trick in some cases.

## SelfHosted Cloud

### NextCloud

1. [Nextcloud Docker Compose üê≥](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Docker/blob/main/Backups/NextCloud/NextCloud_RPi_Stack.yaml)

```sh
sudo flatpak install flathub com.nextcloud.desktopclient.nextcloud -y
#See how quick you are transfering data
#sudo apt install nload
#nload
```

  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Docker/blob/main/Backups/NextCloud/nc_mariadb.yml" title="NextCloud Config File üê≥ ‚Üó"  >}}
{{< /cards >}}

* Recommended Apps inside Nextcloud: cospend (moneybuster Android)
* You can use also NC as a file drop: https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/user_manual/en/files/file_drop.html#setting-up-your-own-file-drop

## WebDavs

With Nextcloud you can also have your files visible via WebDav.

> Add them with: `davs://your_nc_user@nextcloud.yourdomain.duckdns.org/remote.php/webdav` or `dav://your_nc_user@192.168.0.12:8080/remote.php/webdav`

But there are specific apps if you just need a simple web dav.

### SFTP-GO

* https://docs.sftpgo.com/latest/

  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Docker/blob/main/Backups/WebDav/sftpgo_docker-compose.yml" title="See STFP-Go Config File üê≥ ‚Üó"  >}}
  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Home-Lab/blob/main/sftp-go" title="STFP-Go | HomeLab Config üê≥ ‚Üó"  >}}
{{< /cards >}}

```sh
#docker run --name some-sftpgo -p 8080:8080 -p 2022:2022 -d "drakkan/sftpgo:tag"
docker run -d \
  --name sftpgo \
  -p 8066:8080 \
  -p 2022:2022 \
  -v /home/jalcocert/Desktop:/srv \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  drakkan/sftpgo:latest
```

Files will be reflected at `/home/jalcocert/Desktop`, particularly: `./sftpgo/data/yourcreateduser`,

![SFTP-GO verification check](/blog_img/selfh/media/sftpgo.png)


And to connect with your Linux Files, you can add `sftp://jalcocert@192.168.0.12:2022` As the 2022 is the **SFTP Port** and your username.

> **aGPL 3.0** | Full-featured and highly configurable SFTP, HTTP/S, FTP/S and WebDAV server - S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob

* `http://192.168.0.12:8011/web/admin/users`
* http://192.168.0.12:8011/web/client/profile

To add SFTPGo to ubuntu as a space to browse files:

```sh
sudo apt install davfs2
```

> Then use `http://192.168.0.12:8011/web/admin/folders`, `davs://your_nc_user@nextcloud.yourdomain.duckdns.org/remote.php/webdav` or `dav://your_nc_user@192.168.0.12:8080/remote.php/webdav`


{{< callout type="info" >}}
If you are on windows, install **WINSCP** or Filezilla
{{< /callout >}}

```sh
choco install winscp
```

SFTP is a secure way to transfer files over a network. It uses SSH (Secure Shell) to encrypt the data, protecting it from unauthorized access.

```sh
apt-get install iperf3
iperf3 -s #server
iperf3 -c <server IP address> #on the client

```

![alt text](/blog_img/selfh/Sync/iperf3-eth.png)

![alt text](/blog_img/selfh/Sync/iperf3-wifi.png)

```sh
scp /home/user/Downloads/DJI_20250117084726_0009_D your_username@192.168.0.12:/home/your_username/uploads/
```

![alt text](/blog_img/selfh/Sync/scp-file-send.png)

From Windows you can:

```sh
sftp your_username@192.168.0.12
#your_username@192.168.0.12's password:
```

```sh
sftp> cd /home/your_username/uploads
sftp> put "C:\Users\j--e-\Proton Drive\jalcocer\My files\folder\DJI_20250112113040_0012_D.MP4"
sftp> exit
```

You can see the disk load:

```sh
sudo apt install iotop

sudo iotop
```

Yes, when you connect to an SFTP server, you typically need to provide the username and password (or SSH key) of a valid user account on the remote system where the SFTP server is running.

It's not necessarily your Windows user/password unless those credentials happen to be the same on the remote system.

That's a very important distinction! The speed you get with SFTP over your home Wi-Fi will be limited by your **local Wi-Fi speeds**, not your internet upload speed from your ISP. Here's why:

**Local Network vs. Internet Connection**

* **Local Network (LAN):**
    * Your home Wi-Fi network creates a local area network (LAN).
    * When you transfer files between your laptop and server within your home, the data stays within this LAN.
    * The speed of this transfer is determined by your Wi-Fi router's capabilities and the factors mentioned earlier (Wi-Fi standard, interference, etc.).
* **Internet Connection (WAN):**
    * Your internet upload speed from your ISP is relevant when you're transferring files *over the internet* to a server that's located outside your home network.
    * For example, if you were uploading files to a cloud server or a remote server hosted by a different company.

**Why Wi-Fi Speed Matters for Home SFTP:**

* Since your laptop and server are on the same local network, the data doesn't travel through your ISP's network.
* The transfer happens directly between your laptop and server, with the router acting as the intermediary.
* Therefore, the bottleneck is your Wi-Fi speed, not your internet upload speed.

**In summary:**

* **Local transfers (laptop to server on the same Wi-Fi):** Limited by Wi-Fi speed.
* **Internet transfers (laptop to remote server):** Limited by your internet upload speed.

Therefore, if you are transferring files between two computers on your local home network, your internet upload speed is irrelevant.

## Conclusions

These tools can be used together with your [Photo Management Tools](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/photo-management-tools/).

If you need to convert **heic to png**:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libheif-examples
#heif-convert input.heic output.png
for file in *.heic; do heif-convert "$file" "${file%.heic}.png"; done
```

### Sync Speed

This will depend on the router you are using:

I used **iperf and iotop** to check that I get
