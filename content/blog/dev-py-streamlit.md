Streamlit is part of [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/blog/snowflake-to-acquire-streamlit/).

Which you might have heard on the [BigData](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/big-data-tools-for-data-analytics/) context.

### Audio with Streamlit

It was not that straight forward, until I saw this video

See `st.audio_input` - https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/widgets/st.audio_input

### User Authentication

1. https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/user/st.user
2. Using `streamlit-authenticator` as explained [here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/streamlit-is-cool/#provided-users-and-pass)
3. 3rd Party *repurposed* APIs: Like mailerlite or Stripe
4. Via LogTo or similar services like supabase authentication
5. With Traefik combined with middleware like TinyAuth, Authelia, Zitadel...
6. With an internal DB like [sqlite](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Streamlit-MultiChat/tree/main/Z_Tests/Auth_sqlite)

### PyGWalker

## Conclusions

These have been enough so far to develop a couple of Apps:

And to deliver interesting [real estate solutions](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/python-real-estate-mortage-calculator).

Want to Level Up Streamlit?

1. Adding Authelia Authentification
2. Monitoring Streamlit Logs
