## New Web Workflow

These days I have improved my Web creation/edition Workflow.

Im now using Github+Cloudflare and Gitlab+Cloudflare for deployments.

Time to say bye to my old friend Firebase. At least for now.

And to make the dev workflow smoother when Im switching devices...

* I develop via SSH with VSCode with the Opi5 as server
* Everything gets synced thanks to this script

```sh
git clone https://gitlab.com/fossengineer1/cyclingthere
cd ./cyclingthere/pacamara
```

With a regular SSH, I can just use **nano to develop**
```sh
time npm install #~30s
#npm audit fix --force

npm run dev
npm run build
```

But its possible to use VSCode with SSH and **see all the dev environment files**

```sh

```
