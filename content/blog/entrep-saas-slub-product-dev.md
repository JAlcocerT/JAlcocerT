**Tl;DR**

Congratulations, you got [a micro-SaaS like this](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/bring-eyes-to-your-saas/) in front of people and even sold some.

Now what?

**Intro**

Keeping in mind the level of repetitions that you need.

The number of people that is enough to try *or to say no to try* to be significative to then change something.

PROS advice to count in ~ thousands.

Im assuming for this post that you got the product delivery ready for sometime: *yes, we come from [here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/bring-eyes-to-your-saas/)*

With some decent and easy to disgest [user journey workflow, like this one](https://mermaid.live/edit#pako:eNptVWFv4jgQ_Suj7O2V6qAbCJSSDyfRFuhKtMsCveouVCuTDMHbYCPHKWVL__uNnYRCtXwgtvPmefzmefLqhDJCx3dixdZLmF7PBNDv82foCa22MJJc6HxtopnSlcpAyjhB6EY-_FF3v0Rse3oKtdrfu6uEh087GI6CIRMRFzGMWIw-nAxQw78yU9BXiPB9fPKYE-63-ibmkikb8ieMUKVSsIT_YppLkYOGI7vFhMcC7tc-9LnCOUspjUwvdwcErwdcfalWb3n8warh-SrWmYY7tsKUdrxmGncwQNETMRcYDGXMQ8gnvllHRQiYJFl8lPk-Ij--QoMaMZOQwQYkmCai-_HQhy90oBBrczmv_cwENtzaS-dn4_F3RL3VHCMTtSOt6FWwz-D7GDZcL-FKZmsqwaXKdf4o53SJcNJdshO4lSssy2e5zAZ03nQZmD-rCRXIFucBI6sPbcJTGCOLtmWhDDbXbbXCiJtUuqEpzg6mmOpJyERQ5GTGqeHQ0r4rGEqYZblfJ5JFMMFkwUn4cePHVHGWBJVxAy6z8Am1D3YF6oPL06PTldiiiqlmQkMfMZoz6z3-jP9w3ATeuQsDliSotn4pV4pUbb1Ermhoti6YyyCrzYPcVCrTmx50b7pw--22dzc9Pf2g75UUz2RSOr-tdr5OgTapGx4v4avQpPuOXm83lEVAT1OI4kI0Op2a1-zAaHhXpFDgco9rxdckZBaGmKY7uBeJDJ-C_EHBLXdwCX9BvVm7ZlsotHzgIpKbj0boM55kCr_0Xrj-Tap3EorEdmAgxrAkGXkvRVVw2VADposmV1T5iLAr4g1GMtU3MjaVimNUPhkIn5Jt_hbuMqVp65LFrhmaMa4oVVR7bWbiyLelC83ZKmaBjJhA75mSLMqQC2HJ3sH2AmdksqGU68COUutFY0WmS9ryvpXIAztaH_az5NiGZoG8bipRGrGA2VBjG3OW3GGF4YKR4s_mjhyYsOB4PDytIsua7IdsiypfTrN53ocLcX_sQUGXWuKW2kn6Hmh7c_r4scMd37gjg304fj5FER2kNdHbZE-S0gTzxg8LniT-p0VnUU21kk_of_I87xBmbFWAFp1DUDGubXikl35z_XJETp2yCMP6orXAfaRbb7U780NsUfocHV7gefi-TwPbkdc4RJeFyuGuG4aLo9ydKn30eOT4WmVYdVaoyKU0dV4Ny8yhVrHCmePTMMIFyxI9c2bijcLWTPwn5aqMVDKLl46_YElKs2wdUfGvOaNKvkPQmJ5sIrTj113Pcjj-q_NC0_OLs0bTbbRbrue6bfeiVXW2jl9ru-2zjksaeO1657zuNd-qzi-7bf3sonXhXdQb7bp33vDcZrvqUF_WUt3mH3P7TX_7HwwkiCE).

1. Landing with proper loading times, above the fold, ...
2. Ads *or someway of people knowing you* working
3. The product itself right in place, working as your features promise
4. Stripe *or some way* to get the ultimate feedback that what you do is valuable

And...this is it?

Cant I get better?

Of course you can.

And its all about asking the questions:

* Whats working
* Whats not
* ~~Whats next~~: whats the biggest blocker to make it better?

## Some math first

Say your TAM is: 100k every year

Then, 1% of them get to know that you exist when they are on a **BANT state**: *that goes to...1k*

You should know your LTV, and your conversion rate.

Making the income: LTV*Conversion*1k = 100*0,001*1000 = 100$ a year

Wait...I get that little?

After all the tinkering, the building, the promotions...

Arent you even covering adquisition and operational costs?

Lets push the levers to change that.

### A better FAQ


### Emails to show that you are still there

You should be able to query the registered at Firebase/Firestore:

```sh

```

I was doing so with the slidev Firebase version. Same here.
