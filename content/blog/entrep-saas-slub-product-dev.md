**Tl;DR**

Congratulations, you got your SaaS in front of people and even sold some.

Now what?

**Intro**

Keeping in mind the level of repetitions that you need.

The number of people that is enough to try *or to say no to try* to be significative to then change something.

PROS advice to count in ~ thousands.

Im assuming for this post that you got the product delivery ready for sometime: *yes, we come from [here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/bring-eyes-to-your-saas/)*

1. Landing with proper loading times, above the fold, ...
2. Ads *or someway of people knowing you* working
3. The product itself right in place, working as your features promise
4. Stripe *or some way* to get the ultimate feedback that what you do is valuable

And...this is it?

Cant I get better?

Of course you can.

And its all about asking the questions:

* Whats working
* Whats not
* ~~Whats next~~: whats the biggest blocker to make it better?

## Some math first

Say your TAM is: 100k every year

Then, 1% of them get to know that you exist when they are on a **BANT state**: *that goes to...1k*

You should know your LTV, and your conversion rate.

Making the income: LTV*Conversion*1k = 100*0,001*1000 = 100$ a year

Wait...I get that little?

After all the tinkering, the building, the promotions...

Arent you even covering adquisition and operational costs?

Lets push the levers to change that.
