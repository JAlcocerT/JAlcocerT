## HUGO HEXTRA with Github Pages

I suggested to start by cloning this very same repository.


As the HUGO Hextra theme is just ready to roll:

* https://imfing.github.io/hextra/docs/guide/shortcodes/tabs/


1. Download Go: from `go.dev`
2. Download HUGO from github releases: 0.117 as its the ones that works on Github Actions
3. Get in love with Hextra Hugo Theme
4. Discover mermaid.js (with preview at mermaid.live) and get in love with Katex


Commands to know

```sh
hugo server #.\hugo server if you are on windows
hugo #to render if you want to build it locally
