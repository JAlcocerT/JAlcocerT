Because of the makereadme and this post

I got to know about:


We dont want to embed the Front Matter application itself, but rather replicate the user experience of having a powerful Markdown editor with a frontmatter UI within your Flask app.

How you can build a Flask web app with an editor like Front Matter CMS:

**The Core Components**

To achieve this, you'll need to combine a few key technologies:

  * **Flask:** The Python web framework to handle the backend logic.
  * **A Frontend Markdown Editor:** This is the most crucial part. You'll need a robust, JavaScript-based Markdown editor that you can embed in your web pages. This will provide the real-time preview and editing features you're looking for.
  * **A Backend for File Handling:** Your Flask routes will need to handle saving the content from the editor to your file system.
  * **A "Frontmatter" Interface:** You'll build a simple form or a more integrated UI to let users edit the metadata (title, date, slug, etc.) that goes into the YAML frontmatter block.


**For the Markdown Editor**

You have several excellent options for a client-side Markdown editor. These libraries provide the visual interface, the live preview, and often more advanced features like image uploads.

  * **[SimpleMDE](https://github.com/sparksuite/simplemde-markdown-editor)** or its successor, **[EasyMDE](https://github.com/Ionaru/easy-markdown-editor):** These are popular, lightweight, and easy-to-integrate Markdown editors. They have a clean interface and are a great starting point.
  * **[Editor.md](https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/):** A more feature-rich editor that's also popular. It's known for its extensive functionality, including image uploads and full-screen mode.
  * **[Toast UI Editor](https://github.com/nhn/tui.editor):** A modern, powerful editor that supports both Markdown and WYSIWYG modes. It's used in many projects and provides a great user experience.

**For Flask Integration**

  * **Flask extensions:** Many of these JavaScript editors have a corresponding Flask extension that makes integration a breeze.
      * **[Flask-SimpleMDE](https://flask-simplemde.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):** An extension for SimpleMDE.
      * **[Flask-MDEditor](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-MDEditor/):** An extension for Editor.md.
      * **[Flask-MDE](https://github.com/bittobennichan/Flask-MDE):** Another good option for integrating a Markdown editor.
  * **Parsing Markdown and Frontmatter:** On the backend, you'll need a Python library to read and process the Markdown files.
      * **`python-frontmatter`:** This library is perfect for your use case. It can parse a Markdown string, separating the YAML frontmatter from the content body.
      * **`Flask-FlatPages`:** This extension provides a more complete, but opinionated, solution for building a file-based CMS with Flask. It automatically handles reading and parsing Markdown files with frontmatter, making it a good choice for a blog or documentation site.


This approach gives you a complete, file-based CMS with a rich, client-side editing experience that feels very much like using Front Matter CMS, but fully integrated into your Flask application.
