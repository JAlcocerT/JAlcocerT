**Tl;DR**

Do stuff: ebooks and obfuscation, reports, ppts, animations, videos, webpages, etc.


**Intro**

> BC we have to use those OpenAI Prompt packs: https://academy.openai.com/public/tags/prompt-packs-6849a0f98c613939acef841c

> > 

Motion Canvas is great for interactive, visually rich web animations. 

Remotion is best for React developers needing video automation and scaling.

Manim is the tool for deep mathematical visualization with powerful programmatic control.


[Presentations](#ppts-as-a-code): Reveal.js vs [Slidev](https://github.com/slidevjs/slidev)

- Reveal.js is a popular HTML presentation framework that supports Markdown and is flexible but often requires writing HTML for layout and animations. It is widely used but less concise for slide content.[1]
- Slidev is built on Vue.js and Vite, providing an extended Markdown format for creating slides. It is more concise than Reveal.js, supports Vue components for interactive slides, has instant hot-reloading, built-in theming, and recording features. Slidev is very developer-friendly and web-based, allowing extensive customization.[2][1]
- In summary, Slidev is often preferred for modern developer presentations due to ease of use, interactivity, and faster iteration, while Reveal.js remains a flexible, established choice.

Reports: Pandoc vs Typst vs LaTex

- Pandoc is a versatile converter tool supporting Markdown, LaTeX, HTML, DOCX, and many other formats. It is great for converting documents and combining Markdown with raw LaTeX for complex formatting. It requires some setup but is widely used and flexible.[3][4]
- Typst is a relatively new open-source typesetting system designed as a LaTeX alternative, known for a clean syntax inspired by Rust and Python, faster compilation, and easier document styling. It offers good readability of error messages and web collaboration features. It is intuitive for simple to moderately complex documents but less mature than LaTeX.[5][6][3]
- LaTeX is the traditional, powerful typesetting system with extensive features for academic and complex document layouts. It has a steeper learning curve and verbose syntax but the richest ecosystem and long-term support.[3][5]
- Overall, Pandoc is excellent for format conversion and combining Markdown with LaTeX, Typst offers a modern alternative with easier syntax, and LaTeX is ideal for advanced, professionally typeset documents.


| Use Case        | Tool         | Key Strengths                               | Notes                      |
|-----------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Presentations   | Reveal.js    | Flexible, established, supports Markdown    | Requires HTML for layouts  |
|                 | Slidev       | Markdown-based, interactive, fast HMR       | Developer and Vue friendly |
| Reports        | Pandoc       | Format conversion, markdown + LaTeX support | Setup needed               |
|                 | Typst        | Clean, easy modern syntax, fast compile      | Newer, evolving            |
|                 | LaTeX        | Powerful, rich ecosystem for academia        | Steep learning curve       |

This selection depends on priorities: Slidev for modern web presentations, Reveal.js for flexible HTML slides; Pandoc for format conversions, Typst for newer simpler typesetting, and LaTeX for complex document mastery.




### PPTs as a Code



{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/slidev" title="My SliDevJS Fork" image="/blog_img/apps/gh-jalcocert.svg" subtitle="Presentations as a Code pushed to Github Pages" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

1. RevealJS

You can place this one inside HUGO SSG if you want, like: https://github.com/joshed-io/reveal-hugo

2. My favourite: **SliDevJS**: It brings a live editor at `localhost:3030/presenter`

https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/make-slidev/

You can create a [Micro SaaS around Slidev](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/ai-driven-presentations/)

Like: https://github.com/JAlcocerT/slidev-editor with Firebase and Logto auth working as per [this post](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/firebase-auth-101/) :)

![Building in public a slideb editor plus tech talk](/blog_img/entrepre/public-build/slidev-editor/nextjs-slidev-editorlanding.png)



[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=marp-team/marpit,slidevjs/slidev,remarkjs/remark&,type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#marp-team/marpit&slidevjs/slidev&remarkjs/remark&Date)

https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/creating-presentations-with-ai/

![SliDev Real Estate](/blog_img/biz/RE/slidev-re.png)


#### SliDev and Tech Talks

As I feel quite confortable with SliDev, ill be capturing the upcoming interesting tech talk I conduct.

The [latest tech talk](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/slidev-editor/tree/logtojseauth/slidev/slidev-ba-tech-talk), I have place [here](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/slidev-editor/tree/logtojseauth/slidev)

And also any slidev ptt done for youtube tech videos if applies, will be inside [Home-Lab/SlidevJS](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Home-Lab/tree/main/ssg-slidevjs).


```sh
npm init slidev #yarn create slidev
```

**Features I enjoy**: Themes can provide styles, layouts, components, or even configurations for tools.


0. Switching between themes by just **one edit** in your frontmatter
1. Embed Twitter, youtube... thanks to [VUE components](https://sli.dev/builtin/components#youtube), like the demo `./components/Counter.vue`

```yml
#<Tweet id="1866822826696773747" scale="0.5" />
#<Youtube id="fxVNTffZC2U" width="300" height="200" />
```

2. Bring up to date data from API calls. Like `https://open-meteo.com`

3. Make it look cool with mermaidJS / Katex / [**ChartJS** VUE components](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/slidev-editor/tree/logtojseauth/slidev/slidev-101-umami-example/components)

4. This thing can even do animations based on https://motion.vueuse.org/
5. Katex, for those PHD users
6. MermaidJS
7. Export to `pdf`/`pptx` or `png`. *They are all pngs btw, so be mindful if non tech people will have to edit*

> Cool PPTs other created: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BaizeAI/talks/refs/heads/main/packages/2025-06-11-kubecon-hk/slides.md

> > You can combine SliDev + OBS + [FastApi Audio Recorder S2T-TTS](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/audio-recap/#conclusions) for youtube video creation workflow

![FastAPI x Astro x ChartJS pulling data from sqlite](/blog_img/GenAI/audio/fastapi-chartjssqlite.png)

8. RSS...of youtube `CTRL+U`: `https://www.youtube.com/@UnfoldingData/shorts` -> `https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCogC2-5ZqMrLIWtm00RP7Ow` with [this kind of Vue component](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/slidev-editor/blob/logtojseauth/slidev/slidev-101-umami-example/components/LatestYouTubeVideo.vue)

```sh
<LatestYouTubeVideo channelId="UCPPMA8ZEusAe5dVH6PbjZFA" width="400" height="225" />
```

9. Live data via APIs with **custom components**. Like these 2 components, [with open-meteo or yfinance based](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/slidev-editor/tree/logtojseauth/slidev/slidev-ba-tech-talk-exadel/components). 

![Slidev live data component from yfinance](/blog_img/entrepre/public-build/slidev-editor/slidev-component-yfinance.png)

{{< callout type="info" >}}
You can even get away and create one to **pull google sheet data**, so it reflects tables changes in real time
{{< /callout >}}

10. Live stuff: `http://localhost:3030/presenter` and live annonations

> Similarlo to https://github.com/DmytroVasin/DrawPen or with excalidraw


![SliDev Editor inside its UI](/blog_img/entrepre/public-build/slidev-editor/nextjs-slidev-editorlanding.png)

#### Diagrams are also code!

1. With Python, we have: https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/docs/getting-started/examples

2. MermaidJS *you can also use it inside HUGO/Astro/MermaidJS...*

**Had a look to couple of tools for diagrams**

2. https://github.com/stan-smith/FossFLOW

>  Make beautiful isometric infrastructure diagrams 

3. https://markmap.js.org/ and https://github.com/markmap/markmap

It renders text to diagram and can reference files: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/raw/af76a4c245b302206b16aec503dbe07b/markmap.md

> MIT | Build mindmaps with plain text 

4. https://github.com/terrastruct/d2

>  D2 is a modern diagram scripting language that turns text to diagrams. 


### eBooks as a Code

Initially, I thought that [ebooks could be just done via Rmd](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/ebooks)

Then I understood [here, that pandoc](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/ai-driven-ebooks/) is what make the thing work.

And found a [cool SSG Theme to **host your ebook's pdfs** statically](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/sell-your-ebook).

```sh
# Just Astro production
make quick-prod  
```

And it looks as good as: `https://landing-page-book-astro-tailwind.vercel.app/`

Then, I created to just **dump my notes** into future ebooks: https://github.com/JAlcocerT/ebook-ideas

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/ebook-ideas" title="NEW ebook ideas Repo" image="/blog_img/apps/gh-jalcocert.svg" subtitle="Source Code to ship ebooks" >}}
  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/sell-your-ebook" title="sell-your-ebook Repo" image="/blog_img/apps/gh-jalcocert.svg" subtitle="Source Code to ship ebooks" >}}
{{< /cards >}}


{{< callout type="info" >}}
When you create an ebook, use [Foliate](https://github.com/johnfactotum/foliate) to read `epub` on your desktop
{{< /callout >}}

```sh
sudo snap install foliate
```

> Okular or calibre will also do the trick

```sh
convert selfhosting.png ../sell-your-ebook.pdf
```

{{< callout type="info" >}}
EPUB are essentially websites! Thats why they play with with `html`
{{< /callout >}}

You know, just in case you want to create your pdf libre or your epub libre org!

Or to write a e-book for your friend (Anna's archive).

> Others, like [WhyCryptoCurrencies](https://github.com/treeman/why_cryptocurrencies), use [Pollen](https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/index.html) instead

Or...because you can now have deep research agents everywhere:

* https://parallel.ai/pricing - AIs are the web's new user  - The highest accuracy web search for your AI
* Perplexity...
* ...

Some people had problems when trying to convert their Words to epub with amazon tools.

So they others to do it form them and be able to publish to Amazon: `https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/`

But you dont have to do so if you write on a epub friendly format from the get go.


But before going deep and create an ebook, why not creating a **pdf article for your website**?

Like...something for https://www.jalcocertech.com/support/whitepapers/


{{< callout type="info" >}}
From withing th ebook-ideas repo, consider that for [epub use html+calibre](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/ebook-ideas/tree/master/x-html-to-epub) for [pdf use ebook use RMD](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/ebook-ideas/tree/master/x-rmd)
{{< /callout >}}

```sh
git clone https://github.com/JAlcocerT/ebook-ideas.git
x-html-to-epub/build.sh
```

#### Ebooks PDF or Web Version

As seen during the show or [**obfuscate** section of this post](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/ai-driven-ebooks/#show-and-obfuscate) - We can do really cool ebooks and share them as pdf but also place them into a web version.

You write *(markdown)* once, you choose how to publish.

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/obfuscate" title="Obfuscate Repo" image="/blog_img/apps/gh-jalcocert.svg" subtitle="Source Code of Python + Obfuscate + Ebook WebPage" >}}

{{< cards cols="1" >}}
  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Home-Lab/tree/main/pocketbase" title="The setup uses PocketBase to capture emails and allow you to read the e-book as a webpage or download the pdf | Docker Config 🐋 ↗" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

Feel free to combine that setup with a email marketing tool or with stripe for one time payments to get the pdf.

#### Reports as a code

As seen while exploring yfinance on this repo and [post](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/stonks/#eda-on-yfinance).

You can make a one prompt vibe coded report

![Stonks EDA Summary Report](/blog_img/entrepre/public-build/pystonks/eda-stonks.png)

>  *via `yfinance-104.ipynb`*

https://github.com/JAlcocerT/py-stonks/blob/main/z-eda-yfinance/yfinance-104.ipynb

I mean...a real report.

Not just a cool matplotlib graph or a pdf that you vibe coded with a tech solution for jira x pbi.

And then I got to know about [Carbone](https://github.com/carboneio/carbone), which I tinkered with on the [wedding v2 post](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/building-in-public-wedding-photo-galleries/)

>  Fast and simple report generator, from JSON to pdf, xslx, docx, odt... 

{{< tweet user="TheRonnieVShow" id="1980403286349111480" >}}

<!-- https://x.com/TheRonnieVShow/status/1980403286349111480 -->



{{< callout type="info" >}}
We have [Pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc) to convert between tons of formats docx, epub, pdf, md, jsom, latex...
{{< /callout >}}

#### Infographics as a code

This can also be done with Python, but it will look more like a **report or with matplotlib**.

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/python-financial-data-with-yfinance/#with-dividend-reinvestment" title="Animating yfinance" image="/blog_img/data-experiments/MCD_dividends_pct_12m.png" subtitle="YFinance for Python, cool plots and animations | Post" >}}

{{< /cards >}}

```sh
#git clone https://github.com/JAlcocerT/DataInMotion.git
#cd DataInMotion && branch libreportfolio

uv run tests/plot_historical_gweiss.py CAT --start 2005-01-01 --brand "@LibrePortfolio" --warmup-days 400
```

But for *not just yfinance* based, I created:

#### Resume as a Code

Just in case that you need some help with: https://fmhy.net/misc#resume-portfolio

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Whatever you choose, just make sure that its version controlled and parsable by HR
{{< /callout >}}

We make some CV before with [Overleaf and Latex, here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/when-to-apply-for-a-job/#cv-as-a-code).

#### You can do what with PDF?

Not only you can extract PDF info to txt or create PDFs in many ways, like with R language.

{{< cards cols="1" >}}
  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Home-Lab/tree/main/kreuzberg" title="Extract PDF info via Kreuzberg | Docker Config 🐋 ↗" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

```sh
# curl -X POST -F "file=@Ebook-cover-SSGs" http://192.168.1.2:8027/extract
# curl -X POST -F "file=@Ebook-cover-SSGs.pdf" http://192.168.1.2:8027/extract > sample-pdf-to-text.txt
```

With R, you are 5 artifacts away of **creating your first ebook**:

```sh
#cd Z_ebooks #within this repo you have few quick examples!
Rscript ./Z_ebooks/render.R \
  --input ./Z_ebooks/web-ebook.md \
  --output ./Z_ebooks/web-ebook.pdf \

## Video as a Code

[Video editing Thanks to **FFMPEG** and the CLI](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/photo-video-tinkering/#video-editing), of course!

You could also use GUI tools:

![Applying KDENLIVE LUT](/blog_img/outro/kdenlive-lut.png)

But really, just to know the format of the videos of one folder and joining the similar ones together you dont need that:

```sh
bash -lc 'header_printed=0; \
find . -maxdepth 1 -type f \( -iregex ".*\.\(mp4\|mov\|mkv\|avi\|mpg\|mpeg\|wmv\|m4v\|3gp\)$" \) -print0 \
| sort -z \
| while IFS= read -r -d "" f; do \
  base=${f#./}; \
  if [ $header_printed -eq 0 ]; then \
    printf "%-12s %-8s %s\n" "Resolution" "FPS" "File"; \
    printf "%-12s %-8s %s\n" "----------" "----" "----"; \
    header_printed=1; \
  fi; \
  if command -v ffprobe >/dev/null 2>&1; then \
    res=$(ffprobe -v error -select_streams v:0 -show_entries stream=width,height,avg_frame_rate -of default=nw=1:nk=1 "$f" 2>/dev/null); \
    width=$(echo "$res" | sed -n "1p"); \
    height=$(echo "$res" | sed -n "2p"); \
    afr=$(echo "$res" | sed -n "3p"); \
    fps=$(awk -v r="$afr" "BEGIN{split(r,a,\"/\"); if(length(a)==2&&a[2]>0) printf \"%.2f\", a[1]/a[2]; else print r}"); \
    printf "%-12s %-8s %s\n" "${width}x${height}" "${fps}" "$base"; \
  elif command -v mediainfo >/dev/null 2>&1; then \
    info=$(mediainfo --Inform="Video;%Width%x%Height%|%FrameRate%" "$f" 2>/dev/null); \
    printf "%-12s %-8s %s\n" "${info%%|*}" "${info#*|}" "$base"; \
  else \
    printf "%-12s %-8s %s\n" "(install ffprobe or mediainfo)" "-" "$base"; \
  fi; \
done'

# Resolution   FPS      File
# ----------   ----     ----
# 3840x2160    50.00    DJI_20251003204711_0010_D.MP4
# 3840x2160    50.00    DJI_20251003204913_0011_D.MP4

```


You can always add music to your videos: https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary?feature=blog

```sh
ffmpeg -y -i initial_silenced_video.mp4 -stream_loop -1 -i afilador_101.mp3 \
  -c:v copy -c:a aac -shortest -map 0:v:0 -map 1:a:0 \
  ./resulting-video-with-audio.mp4
```

{{< youtube "YanaJiC_cYk" >}}




### Animations as a Code


As we saw in summer, we can do [cool animations as a code](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/animations-as-a-code/)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/JAlcocerT/DataInMotion
#git branch -a
git fetch --all --prune && (git switch libreportfolio || git switch --track origin/libreportfolio) && git pull

uv run animate_sequential_compare_price_evolution_flex_custom.py GLD BTC-USD 2025-01-01 10 short

ffmpeg -y -i gld-btc.mp4 -stream_loop -1 -i afilador_101.mp3 \
  -c:v copy -c:a aac -shortest -map 0:v:0 -map 1:a:0 \
  ./gld-btc-audio.mp4
```

Do animation logic once, ship it everywhere:

{{< tweet user="LibrePortfolio" id="1940181314587828581" >}}

<!-- https://x.com/LibrePortfolio/status/1940181314587828581 -->

> With the proper data model, you can save the Google Sheets read with `=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDEUR"; "price"; FECHA(AÑO(HOY()); 1; 1); HOY(); "DAILY")`

> > Or `=GoogleFinance("CURRENCY:BTCUSD"; "price"; HOY()-30; HOY())` 

Not to mention the possibility to vibe code very quickly this [kind of aggregates within st](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/DataInMotion/blob/libreportfolio/streamlit_portfolio_aggregate.py).

See how quickly you can iterate through your ideas:

```sh
uv run streamlit run streamlit_portfolio_aggregate.py
#uv run streamlit run streamlit_ath_viewer.py #from WK42Y25
#uv run streamlit run LibrePortfolio-Plots.py #a better version of streamlit_ath_viewer and streamlit_script_plots
```

![Streamlit price and dividends of a portfolio aggregated](/blog_img/dev/streamlit-stocks-aggregates.png)

```sh
#from the same libreportfolio branch
uv run LibrePortfolio-PlotsFlask.py

docker compose build --no-cache
#sudo docker compose up -d
#sudo docker compose down #test of the image over
```

Then just make the built webapp container public with portainer+cloudflare with `libreportfolio-flask:8501` to `https://graficas.libreportfolio.fyi/`

Record and Share: *because [people share even gsheets](https://x.com/vecinoinversor_/status/1674359289886957568)*

```sh
ffmpeg -y -i untitled.mp4 -stream_loop -1 -i ImmortaYT.mp3 \
  -c:v copy -c:a aac -shortest -map 0:v:0 -map 1:a:0 \
  ./graficas-libreportfolio.mp4
```

<!-- 
https://x.com/LibrePortfolio/status/1980278163155333315 -->

You know, we can do [animation as a code as seen **with matplotlib**](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/animations-as-a-code/).

And you should probably place your codes into a [repo like DataInMotion](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/DataInMotion) if you go that route.

What if you have *couple of brands* and want to **recycle your animations**?


You can even create a **quick** streamlit, then flask **web apps around animations** to let other create with your tools:

```sh
uv run streamlit run LibrePortfolio-Plots.py 
uv run LibrePortfolio-PlotsFlask.py
docker compose build --no-cache
```

Make it visible on social media.

Because lets be honest: website traffik is broken with AI.

So...wait, didnt we already...?

Matplotlib can be used for creating basic 2D animations and exporting them as videos or GIFs, mainly for data visualizations and scientific plots.

It supports animation classes that update frames over time, but it is limited in terms of creative, sophisticated motion graphics or professional video production and interactivity.

In contrast, tools like Motion Canvas, Remotion, or Manim provide much richer features for video animations with more control, flexibility, and higher production value. 

They are specialized for creating engaging presentations, explainer videos, or educational animations beyond simple graph animations.

Blender is a professional 3D modeling and animation software, and yes, it supports scripting—usually with Python—to automate scene creation, object manipulation, lighting, and camera control. This scripting allows creating complex 3D scenes and animations programmatically.

Blender scripting is powerful for 3D animations, simulations, and rendering, which is quite different and much more advanced compared to 2D animation libraries like Matplotlib.

- Matplotlib: Best for simple 2D scientific animations, basic video export.
- Motion Canvas/Remotion/Manim: Better suited for rich 2D animated videos and educational content.
- Blender: Professional 3D animation software with Python scripting for complex 3D scenes and animations.

> So, for video animations where creative flexibility and professional output matter, tools like Motion Canvas or Remotion are superior to Matplotlib. 

> > For 3D scenes and animations via coding, Blender scripting is the go-to solution.


Motion Canvas, Remotion, and Manim are all tools for creating **programmatic animations and videos**, but they cater to different use cases and technologies.

Motion Canvas is a modern TypeScript-based tool focused on vector animations with real-time preview and strong web integration.

It is praised for allowing CSS features and live timing control in animations but is still relatively new with fewer complex examples and features compared to others.

It targets users who prefer coding animations with web tech and want interactive previews while creating.

Remotion stands out as a React-based tool for creating programmatic videos. It enables creating MP4 videos using React components, making it excellent for developers familiar with React who want to automate and scale video production. 

Remotion is well-regarded for strong documentation, ease of use, and a focus on collaborative and dynamic video creation, including applications like product videos and in-browser editing.

Manim, on the other hand, is a Python library specialized in math and educational animations. It offers fine-grained control for precise formula animation and algorithm visualization.

It requires more programming expertise and manual effort but is powerful for STEM use cases.

Recent research advances also use AI to automate some Manim coding, improving accessibility.

Manim excels in complex mathematical and algorithmic animations rather than general vector or video creation.[7][8][9]

### Animations x SSG

This year I also was playing around with Astro components.

And withing the datanova theme, I found out that they are doing a really cool animation (which is a SVG!)

```sh
npm install
#npm run dev
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4321 #http://192.168.1.11:4321/
```


### Video Geolocation with FFMPEG

https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Py_RouteTracker

With a GoPro and its metadata, it's all about:

```sh
exiftool GX011032.MP4
exiftool -ee GX011032.MP4
```

> Make sure to record with GPS on to bring that lovely Geo data.

For just accelerations:

```sh

```

### Writing Posts with Codex

As seen during summer on [this post](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/tech-for-podcast/#conclusions).

How about using **Codex CLI** to write SSG posts?

{{< cards cols="1" >}}
  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Home-Lab/tree/main/codex-cli" title="Codex CLI | Docker Config 🐋 ↗" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Home-Lab
cd codex-cli

docker compose -f docker-compose.codex.yml up -d --build

# To stop the container (using either method):
# docker compose -f docker-compose.codex.yml down  # Using compose
# docker stop codex-container && docker rm codex-container  # Using container name
docker exec -it codex-container bash
codex #And ask anything you want!
```

3. Access the container:

```bash
docker exec -it codex-container bash
```

Just in case that you dont want to do the [n8n + CMS API](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/automating-ghost-and-wordpress/).
