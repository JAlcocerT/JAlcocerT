2. [P. Levels](https://levels.io/blog/) created this interesting webApp:

> Looks like inflation was there before *the experts* informing :)

There is an API: https://inflationchart.com/api

In real life, as per [this post](https://forocoches.com/foro/showthread.php?t=10479839), a menu has gone up from ~8 to ~14.
