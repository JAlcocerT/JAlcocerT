{{< details title="CCer for Cable Modems ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

**CCer refers to Correctable Codeword Errors** in the context of cable modems, specifically those using DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) standards.

This term is related to the way data is transmitted and maintained for integrity over cable networks. Hereâ€™s an overview:

- **Purpose of CCer**: 
  - **Correctable Codeword Errors** indicate instances where data packets transmitted over the cable network have encountered errors due to noise or interference but have been corrected by the modemâ€™s error-correction algorithms. 
  - CCer is a metric used to measure the quality and reliability of a cable network connection. A high number of correctable errors might not immediately affect the user's experience but can be an early indicator of potential issues in the network that could escalate to uncorrectable errors.

- **How it Works**:
  - Cable modems use a type of error correction called **Forward Error Correction (FEC)**. This method adds redundant data to the transmitted information, which helps the receiving device (cable modem) to detect and correct errors that may have occurred during transmission.
  - CCer counts the codewords (blocks of data) that have had errors but were corrected by the FEC. It is different from UCer (Uncorrectable Codeword Errors), which refers to data errors that could not be fixed by FEC.

- **Applicability to Cable Modems**:
  - CCer is specifically relevant to cable modems because of their reliance on coaxial cable networks, which are susceptible to various types of interference and signal degradation.
  - In optical networks, such as those using GPON (Gigabit Passive Optical Network) or XGS-PON technologies, data integrity issues are handled differently, often with different error correction and detection mechanisms due to the nature of optical transmission.

### Dedicated VoIP Phones

- **Hardware-based VoIP Phones**: These look similar to traditional telephones but connect to the internet instead of a standard telephone line. They have built-in IP technology to manage the routing of voice data over an internet connection.

### Computers
- **Softphones**: Software applications installed on computers that enable voice calls over the internet using a microphone and speakers or a headset. Examples include Skype, Zoom, or Google Voice.

### Mobile Devices
- **VoIP Apps on Smartphones and Tablets**: Mobile devices can use apps like WhatsApp, Viber, or FaceTime Audio to make voice calls over the internet. These apps use the deviceâ€™s data connection (Wi-Fi or cellular data) to transmit voice.

### Analog Telephone Adapters (ATA)
- **ATA Devices**: These devices allow traditional analog telephones to be connected to the internet for VoIP services. They convert analog voice signals into digital data that can be transmitted over the internet.

### Specialized VoIP Adapters and Routers
- **Integrated VoIP Routers**: Some routers come with built-in VoIP support, allowing direct connection of traditional phones and routing of VoIP calls alongside normal internet traffic.

### Not Typically VoIP Devices
- **Smart TVs**: While smart TVs are capable of internet connectivity and can support apps for streaming services like Netflix, they are generally not used for VoIP communications. Their primary function is media consumption rather than voice communication.

VoIP technology is versatile and can be implemented across various devices, but it primarily revolves around voice communication capabilities rather than media streaming. Devices used for VoIP need to support audio input and output, have a stable internet connection, and be equipped with the necessary software to manage voice data packets.

{{< details title="What's a Set-top boxðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

Set-top boxes (STBs) are primarily devices that receive and decode digital television broadcasts from satellite, cable, or broadband sources to display on a television or similar display device. They are not inherently Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) devices.

 However, with the advancement in technology and integration of various services, some modern set-top boxes can support VoIP functionality if they are connected to the internet and have the necessary software and hardware capabilities to handle voice communications.

Here's a breakdown of their functionalities:

- **Primary Function of Set-Top Boxes**:
  - Receive, decode, and display digital television signals.
  - Provide access to on-demand content, streaming services, and interactive television applications.

- **VoIP Functionality**:
  - Some advanced set-top boxes can integrate VoIP features, allowing users to make voice calls over the internet.
  - This integration typically requires the set-top box to be connected to the internet and configured with VoIP software.

- **Device Integration**:
  - Integration of multiple services like internet browsing, media streaming, and VoIP on a single device like a set-top box offers a unified home entertainment and communication solution.

In summary, while traditional set-top boxes are not VoIP devices, the convergence of home technology can enable them to support VoIP services alongside their primary functions.

- **OTT (Over-The-Top)** refers to content and services provided over the internet that bypass traditional distribution. In the context of telecommunications, OTT services relate to media streaming, communication, and other internet-based services that do not require users to subscribe to traditional cable or satellite pay-TV services. Hereâ€™s a detailed look at OTT and its relevance:

{{< details title="More about OTT ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

- **Over-The-Top**: The term "over-the-top" implies that these services go 'over' a traditional cable or satellite TV system to provide content directly to viewers via the internet.
- **Types of Services**:
  - **Video Streaming**: Services like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney+ that offer on-demand content.
  - **Audio Streaming**: Platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, and Pandora.
  - **Communication Services**: Applications like WhatsApp, Skype, and Zoom that provide messaging, voice, and video calling functionalities without the need for traditional telecommunication services.

Relation to Telecom
- **Data Traffic**: OTT services contribute significantly to data traffic on telecom networks. As more users stream high-definition video or engage in video conferencing, the demand for robust and high-speed data services increases.
- **Revenue Models**: While OTT providers primarily generate revenue through subscriptions, advertisements, or pay-per-view models, telecom operators may leverage this demand by offering bundled data packages, high-speed internet plans, or partnering with OTT platforms.
- **Network Infrastructure**: The rising popularity of OTT services pushes telecom companies to invest in upgrading their network infrastructure to handle increased data loads and provide uninterrupted, high-quality service.

Impact and Trends
- **Consumer Behavior**: The convenience and variety of content offered by OTT platforms have led to a shift in consumer behavior, with more users opting for internet-based entertainment solutions over traditional TV.
- **Regulatory Attention**: The growth of OTT services has attracted regulatory scrutiny regarding issues like data privacy, net neutrality, and fair competition practices.
- **Innovation and Competition**: The OTT space is highly competitive and drives continuous innovation in content delivery technologies, such as improved compression algorithms and adaptive streaming techniques.

OTT services in telecommunications represent a significant shift in how content is delivered and consumed. They bypass traditional broadcast methods to provide direct-to-consumer streaming services via the internet. This shift not only affects consumer preferences and behaviors but also influences the strategic operations and infrastructure development of telecom companies. As OTT continues to grow, it remains a critical area for innovation, investment, and regulation in the telecom sector.

### APHYRates

In essence, "APHYRate" is a metric used in the analysis of **wireless network performance**, particularly when evaluating the **impact of interference on data transmission speeds**.


{{< details title="More about aPHYrates ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

Based on the search results, "APHYRate" appears in the context of analyzing wireless network performance, specifically within IEEE 802.11 networks (Wi-Fi).

It relates to the change or difference in the PHY rate (physical layer rate) due to factors like interference. Here's a breakdown:

* **PHY Rate:**
    * This refers to the data transfer rate at the physical layer of a wireless network. It's the raw speed at which data is transmitted over the air.
* **APHYRate:**
    * From the provided scientific papers, it seems that "APHYRate" is used to describe the change in the PHY rate that occurs due to things like adjacent channel interference. So it is the result of a calculation that shows the difference in the PHY rate.
    * In the context of the research papers, it is used in calculations to determine the effects of interference on network throughput.

{{< /details >}}

Since APHYRate represents a change in the PHY rate, it is measured in the same units as the PHY rate itself. Therefore, the units for APHYRate are:

* **Mbps (Megabits per second)**: This is the most common unit for measuring data transfer rates in wireless networks.

So, when you see APHYRate values, they will typically be expressed in Megabits per second (Mbps), indicating the change in the data transmission speed.


### MTA

**Multimedia Terminal Adapter:**

* This is a piece of hardware used in cable telecommunications. It allows you to use traditional telephone services over a cable internet connection.
* This is very relevant to cable based phone services.

- **Pod as Root Node**: For customers without a Cable Modem (CM) provided by LibG, control over these pods is not possible; only monitoring of pod behavior is feasible.

- **TCID Usage**: Instead of using MAC addresses, an ODH-generated ID (TCID) should be considered as a primary key for these cases.
   - **Data Filtering**: It may be necessary to introduce a filter in our pipelines to identify scenarios where the pods act as root nodes and no CM is present.
   - **Data Collection by Plume**: Pods equipped with **OpenSync software** can send their logs to the Plume cloud for monitoring. This includes pods that do not have a parent CM but are capable of sending data due to the presence of OpenSync software.

#### Kibana and ES

These tools have have something to say.

You can use **DSL queries** to explore data within Kibana, which pulls from **Elastic Search** DB.

```json
{
  "query": {
    "prefix": {
      "node.keyword": {
        "value": "FN-LC0001"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Which can be...

```json
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "filter": [
        {
          "script": {
            "script": {
              "source": "doc['node.keyword'].value.startsWith(params.site)",
              "params": {
                "site": "FN-LC0001"  // Replace with your site variable
              }
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

<!-- Summarizing what we have discussed in this meeting - The issue we discussed is: how close to real time we can get the anomaly detection:
   â€¢ By using the existing unified pipeline:
      â—‹ Constrains: 
         Â§ PLUME data gets processed to start our pipeline already ~4h behind
         Â§ From that point the unified pipeline gets executed - I have checked and to perform all the joins in pick hours have found between 30-45 min
         Â§ Then, the aggregations to feed the model starts - This is around 5-10 min
      â—‹ After this, that aggregated table has to be synced to GCS and feed the model.
What we know for now, is that given the current topology (cmts, GW Type and GW Firmware), the model can predict anomalies in 5-10min.
      â—‹ Finally, get the output to Graphite, so that its displayed on Grafana.
      â—‹ Important: As we are using the unified pipeline, we will predict error on WIFI connected STB's only. Also the STB's that act as their own GW are not considered here.
   â€¢ What we called, plan B - Model feed using only Streamparser: 
Since the information that we are using for the anomaly detection (cmts, GW Type and GW Firmware) is found in Streamparser kafka topic, we could bypass waiting time of the plume data and perform:
      â—‹ Perform the aggregation to feed the model with streamparser data only.
      â—‹ Sync to GCS that table and execute the model.
      â—‹ Get the output to grafana for the final display.
      â—‹ Important: with this approach we will be detecting anomalies in both, WIFI and ETH connected STB's (we avoided client_stats). Also we would see SMT's as well. This might increase the processing time of the model to detect anomalies. But as our current data refresh it would be already accelerating everything by 4h.
The next steps:
   â€¢ We will continue with the first option for the upcoming demo of the dashboard with the anomaly detection.
   â€¢ We expect that on WK10 (From next Tuesday) we can work with MLOps on the integration of the Trained Model into GCP.
Please let me know if any further questions. -->

[Project Enhancement] Assistance Requested for Data Integration in Pipeline

**Context:**
To enhance our current project model, we require:
  - Linking specific device data from the data parsing system with user statistics, focusing on individual device identifiers rather than group identifiers.
  - Inclusion of devices connected to the latest generation hardware, which is currently missing from our data.

**Objectives:**
  - Address issues noted in internal tracking system entries #10501 and #10464.
    - For the existing data flow: [Data Pipeline URL](#faq)
    - Integrating data related to the latest hardware generation into the pipeline.
    - Ensuring device identifiers (similar to user statistics identifiers) are included in the data parsing output.
  - Collaborate with the Data Engineering and Data Science teams to decide on future actions and prioritize tasks.
  - Discuss potential challenges and explore solutions to mitigate them.

Please confirm your attendance by accepting the meeting invitation. If you are unable to attend, inform me at your earliest convenience so we can arrange another suitable time if needed. -->
