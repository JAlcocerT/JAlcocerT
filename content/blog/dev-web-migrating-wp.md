I was talking with my father about websites the other day and...

I realized how much **more we can do with SSG's than with wordpress**.

It all started trying to add Web Analytics to his site.

We wanted to add Umami Analytics - The same im using for this site (which is GDPR compliant out of the box and non invasive for the readers).

> It turned out that you need a business suscription to add Plugins (WPCode could have solve it).

We tried to add the Umami script on the wordpress Theme, but the option was also not available.

## Why there are better options?

* This is how google sees the templates (the higher rating, the better):

![Wordpress Google Page Speed Desktop](/blog_img/web/jmodels-google-pagespeed-desktop.png)

and for mobile (a responsive site is even more important here):

![Wordpress Google Page Speed Mobile](/blog_img/web/jmodels-google-pagespeed-mobile.png)

* The ping doesnt look so bad actually, but...

![Pinging Wordpress vs SSG](/blog_img/web/ping_comparison.png)

...the http request has a huge gap. And its not this particular website's fault.

We can [use Uptime Kuma](https://fossengineer.com/selfhosting-uptime-Kuma-docker/) to check the **http request response** time for both, Wordpress and Wix official websites:

![Http request Wix](/blog_img/web/uptimekuma-wix.png)

![Http request WP](/blog_img/web/uptimekuma-wp.png)

Observe how for both platforms they provide a ~500ms speed and http requests (these are the ones that we care about as users).

> When you use SSG's, you can expect to have it around ~100ms instead, **x5 faster**

* If you are concerned about the environment, speed also means less processing required, hence **less emissions**!

### The Challenges

Writing posts on md a IDE...that can cause some friction.

I proposed to have a look to:

* https://vscode.dev/
  * Alternatively Github Codespaces or Gitlab Web IDE can do
  * You can also provide [VSCode as a container](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Docker/blob/main/Dev/vscode-server_Docker-compose.yml)
* letsMarkdown

{{< details title="A quick look on how to use markdown ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

```sh
docker run --rm -dp 3030:3030 cveinnt/letsMarkdown #https://github.com/Cveinnt/LetsMarkdown.com

### Interesting Search Engines

* Ecosia.org / qwant.com / Brave / DuckDuckGo
* [Whoogle/SearXNG](https://jalcocert.github.io/RPi/posts/selfh-internet-better/)
* Bing 

It's worth to try few of them - not all the content is indexed in the same way across engines

**Thanks to Ecosia** I could find how to add Web Analytics to the Jekyll Chirpy Theme!
