I was talking with my father about websites the other day and...

I realized how much more we can do with SSG's than with wordpress.

It all started trying to add Web Analytics to his site.

We wanted to add Umami Analytics - The same im using for this site (which is GDPR compliant out of the box and non invasive for the readers).

> It turned out that you need a business suscription to add Plugins (WPCode could have solve it).

We tried to add the Umami script on the wordpress Theme, but the option was also not available.

## Why there are better options?

### The challenges

Writing posts on md a IDE...that can cause some friction.

I proposed to have a look to:

* https://vscode.dev/
* letsMarkdown

{{< details title="A quick look on how to use markdown ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

```sh
docker run --rm -dp 3030:3030 cveinnt/letsMarkdown #https://github.com/Cveinnt/LetsMarkdown.com

### CDN and Videos for your Website

### Interesting Search Engines

* Ecosia.org / qwant.com / Brave / DuckDuckGo
* [Whoogle/SearXNG](https://jalcocert.github.io/RPi/posts/selfh-internet-better/)
* Bing 

It's worth to try few of them - not all the content is indexed in the same way across engines
