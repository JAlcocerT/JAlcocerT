I was talking with my father about websites the other day and...

I realized how much more we can do with SSG's than with wordpress.

It all started trying to add Web Analytics to his site.

We wanted to add Umami Analytics - The same im using for this site (which is GDPR compliant out of the box and non invasive for the readers).

> It turned out that you need a business suscription to add Plugins (WPCode could have solve it).

We tried to add the Umami script on the wordpress Theme, but the option was also not available.

## Why there are better options?

### SSG Alternatives

* https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack
  * Supports https://photoswipe.com/ out of the box!


### The challenges

Writing posts on md a IDE...that can cause some friction.

I proposed to have a look to:

* https://vscode.dev/
  * Alternatively Github Codespaces or Gitlab Web IDE can do
  * You can also provide [VSCode as a container](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Docker/blob/main/Dev/vscode-server_Docker-compose.yml)
* letsMarkdown

```sh
docker run --rm -dp 3030:3030 cveinnt/letsMarkdown #https://github.com/Cveinnt/LetsMarkdown.com
```

```sh
#podman run --rm -it ghcr.io/linkchecker/linkchecker:latest --verbose https://fossengineer.com > linkchecker_output.txt

docker run --rm -it -u $(id -u):$(id -g) ghcr.io/linkchecker/linkchecker:latest --verbose https://www.example.com
```

* Option 2: with the [python Package](https://pypi.org/project/LinkChecker/)

```sh
pip3 install linkchecker #Check links in web documents or full websites
```

You will get a report with whatâ€™s link working and what not when it comes to Links in your Site.

### CDN and Videos for your Website

* https://github.com/orthdron/subatic - Extremely simple video hosting Site that scales with you



### Interesting Search Engines

* Ecosia.org / qwant.com / Brave / DuckDuckGo
* [Whoogle/SearXNG](https://jalcocert.github.io/RPi/posts/selfh-internet-better/)
* Bing 

It's worth to try few of them - not all the content is indexed in the same way across engines
