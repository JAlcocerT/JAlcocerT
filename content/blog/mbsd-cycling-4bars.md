**Tl;DR**

Is the 4 bar mechanism everywhere?

Or is it just my head?

**Intro**

4 bars: leg-leg-biela bicicleta

## About MBSD

How...have I arrived here?

Its a long story.

I got sold on been a good student.

Wanted to have a career on sth solid, so went for engineering instead of physics.

Decisions taken on verbal information - *like a pro, w/o validating / cross-checking*

{{% steps %}}

### Some Math Wont Hurt

Spent time understanding calculus and algebra.

Again: understanding, not operating.

### Love for physics

### Bike Dynamics Thesis

### D&A has real demand!

### Found Mechanism Project

Forked it and created a personal PoC

and put together some 101 with the equations with [python sympy](#about-python-sympy)

### Today

Fast-forward until today.

because from 2023 it has all been learn/do/learn/do around AI.

You can demonstrate it step by step:

Or...simulate it: *under the hood its just same hypothesis and equations*
