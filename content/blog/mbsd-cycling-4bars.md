**Tl;DR**

Is the 4 bar mechanism everywhere?

Or is it just my head?

**Intro**

Some math, some physics, some mechanics.

And some [personal journey](#about-mbsd) for starters before going all in with MBSD.

4 bars: leg-leg-biela bicicleta

Its all about 4 bars and a Rigid Solid.

## About MBSD

How...have I arrived here?

Its a long story.

I got sold on been a good student.

Wanted to have a career on sth solid, so went for engineering instead of physics.

Decisions taken on verbal information - *like a pro, w/o validating / cross-checking*

### Some Math Wont Hurt

Spent time understanding calculus and algebra.

Again: understanding, not operating.

### Love for physics

### Bike Dynamics Thesis

How could i not go all in on real time 3d motion simulation for bicycles?

* https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Bike_dynamic_simulator

They are crazy efficient in [$/km terms](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/buying-bicycle-through-data-analytics/)

### D&A has real demand

And thats why I pivoted to D&A career.

The dev part was just to sell at scale

### Found Mechanism Project

Forked it and created a personal PoC from scratch:

* https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Slider-Crank
* https://github.com/JAlcocerT/mechanism

and put together some 101 with the equations with [python sympy](#about-python-sympy)

### Today

Fast-forward until today.

Because from 2023 it has all been learn/do/learn/do around AI.

## Conclusions

Some time ago, I was wondering if: Julia: optimization, eq solver, symbolic algebra, jump library would be the way to go.

Would Python be the best approach to find the math behind mechanism that cant block along their movement?

Some kind of automated mechanism synthesis.

Matlab ---> a python – programa sintesis mec generalizado.

### Maximum piston speed with formula

You can demonstrate it step by step:

Or...simulate it: *under the hood its just same hypothesis and equations*
