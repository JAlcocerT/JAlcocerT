I know we cant know about everything.

But the amount of close people that its trying to build something on social media, yet does not have a website still amazes me.

Why not giving a try to linktree, many.link... pricing?

Then, lets have a look to solutions that will **just require your time**.

## SSG Solutions for LinkInBios

**Hugo example** and Lynx

We can use [HUGO SSG](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/using-hugo-as-website/) together with the [Lynx Theme](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/portfolio-website-for-social-media/) and have a quick Linktree alternative.

You dont really need anything to get started, as we can make this work [with Github Pages](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/how-to-use-github-pages/).

## Bento Portfolio as LinkinBio Alternative

There is the possibility to use **Bento Themes with Astro**:

1. For example, this astro bento portfolio, which I used with Github Pages for the web3 sample blog:

You can also have a look to:

> I have forked this one here - https://github.com/JAlcocerT/techtim-astro-bento-portfolio

And you can use it by:

```sh
npm install

npm run dev
#npm run build

#rm -rf .git
```

Remember to tweak:

1. All content from `/public` and `/src/content` as per the original theme License
2. The `index.astro` file calls the individual components, like `../components/sections/AboutMe.astro`
