I know we cant know about everything.

But the amount of close people that its trying to build something on social media, yet does not have a website still amazes me.

Why not giving a try to linktree, many.link... pricing?

Then, lets have a look to solutions that will just require your time:

**Hugo example** and Lynx

We can use [HUGO SSG](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/using-hugo-as-website/) together with the [Lynx Theme](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/portfolio-website-for-social-media/) and have a quick Linktree alternative.

You dont really need anything to get started, as we can make this work [with Github Pages](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/how-to-use-github-pages/).
