{{< details title="What would Cicero Think about Crypto?" closed="true" >}}

* Protection Against Arbitrary Power

- **Cicero’s View:**
  - Clear, consistent laws safeguard against tyranny or arbitrary rule.
  - Without laws, society is governed by the whims of those in power, leaving people without protection or fairness.

- **Complexity’s Role:**
  - A well-designed system of rules provides structure and predictability.
  - Everyone—whether ruler or citizen—is theoretically bound by these rules, leveling the playing field and reducing the ability of any one person or group to impose their will unfairly.

* Risk of Over-Regulation or **Tyranny of Rules**

- **Too Many Rules:**
  - Excessively complex systems can result in over-regulation.
  - People may struggle to navigate the legal or bureaucratic framework, hindering personal freedoms.
  - Complex rules can concentrate power among those who manipulate or interpret the system.

- **Inaccessibility:**
  - Complex rules create a divide between those who understand the law (experts, bureaucrats, the wealthy) and the general population.
  - Individuals may feel oppressed or disadvantaged without the resources to navigate or challenge the system.

My point is: I dont have any idea about Solidity, Smart Contracts or whatever code goberns crypto.

But...I think many of us know how to use AI already (particularly LLMs) - to get some ideas of what are we interacting with.

Understanding SC's with LLMs: these are are some [interesting protocols](https://dappradar.com/rankings/defi?sort=tvlInFiat&order=desc)
