Here we go again...

I was testing [Astro Bento Portfolio + Github Pages + Github CI/CD](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/web3) with the resulting Web3/Crypto related microblog [here](https://jalcocert.github.io/web3/).

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
This post is just describing the process to apply data analytics with crypto. **Not any recommendation or financial advice of any type.**
{{< /callout >}}

And some time ago I was having a look to this **amazing BlockChain/Solidity FreeCodeCamp course:**

{{< youtube "gyMwXuJrbJQ" >}}

Practical Blockchain:
- Parties that do not know each other can exchange value without a central authority.

I decided to create [the **InsighChAIn Project**](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/PyInsightChAIn). Knowledge from [the Scrap project](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Scrap_Tools) and practically from [CVCreAItor](/ai-useful-yet-simple/) 💻

{{< details title="What would Cicero Think about Crypto?" closed="true" >}}

* Protection Against Arbitrary Power

- **Cicero’s View:**
  - Clear, consistent laws safeguard against tyranny or arbitrary rule.
  - Without laws, society is governed by the whims of those in power, leaving people without protection or fairness.

- **Complexity’s Role:**
  - A well-designed system of rules provides structure and predictability.
  - Everyone—whether ruler or citizen—is theoretically bound by these rules, leveling the playing field and reducing the ability of any one person or group to impose their will unfairly.

* Risk of Over-Regulation or **Tyranny of Rules**

- **Too Many Rules:**
  - Excessively complex systems can result in over-regulation.
  - People may struggle to navigate the legal or bureaucratic framework, hindering personal freedoms.
  - Complex rules can concentrate power among those who manipulate or interpret the system.

- **Inaccessibility:**
  - Complex rules create a divide between those who understand the law (experts, bureaucrats, the wealthy) and the general population.
  - Individuals may feel oppressed or disadvantaged without the resources to navigate or challenge the system.

My point is: I dont have any idea about Solidity, Smart Contracts or whatever code goberns crypto.

But...I think many of us know how to use AI already (particularly LLMs) - to get some ideas of what are we interacting with.

> Let's try to get clarification on some Smart Contract

Understanding SC's with LLMs: these are are some [interesting protocols](https://dappradar.com/rankings/defi?sort=tvlInFiat&order=desc)

## Crypto Analytics

There are of course some platforms already for this.

But as this is all public, how about...exploring a BTC wallet?

Like the one offered for donations at duckdns:

* https://btcscan.org/address/16gHnv3NTjpF5ZavMi9QYBFxUkNchdicUS

{{< cards cols="1" >}}
  {{< card link="https://fossengineer.com/selfhosting-nginx-proxy-manager-docker/" title="DuckDNS+NGINX is a very cool setup, btw" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

And that exploration of a wallet can be [done with Python](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Streamlit-AIssistant/blob/main/Z_Tests/Crypto/btc_explore.ipynb)!

[![Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JAlcocerT/Streamlit-AIssistant/blob/main/Z_Tests/Crypto/btc_explore.ipynb)

{{< details title="Crypto - SelfServing Dashboards & Analytics Platforms: Dune and more 📌" closed="true" >}}

I have used [Dune-Analytics](https://dune.com/), together with [SQL](/sql-data-analytics/)

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Particularly, to make a [UniSwap Protocol Dashboard](https://dune.com/fossengineer/uniswap).
{{< /callout >}}


1. **DeBank**:
   - **Free Tier**: DeBank offers a free version that includes basic features for tracking and managing decentralized finance (DeFi) portfolios, such as token balances, transaction histories, and portfolio insights across multiple chains.
   - **Usage**: Popular among users for its clean, easy-to-use interface and chain aggregation features.

2. **Zapper**:
   - **Free Tier**: Zapper provides free access to basic DeFi portfolio tracking and yield farming analytics. It aggregates data from various DeFi protocols and presents it in a unified dashboardsage**: A favorite for users tracking multiple DeFi investments across different platforms, with an intuitive user interface.

3. **Nansen**:
   - **Free Tier**: The free version of Nansen offers basic tracking features but with significant limitations, including access to limited data on wallet activity and DeFi protocols .
   - Advanced features, such as more detailed analytics, deeper insights into DeFi protocols, and enhanced filtering, are available through paid plans.

4. **Dune Analytics**:
   - **Free Tier**: Dune offers a free version that allows users to query and visualize blockchain data using SQL. However, query limits and access to certain advanced dashboards are restricted .
   - **Paid Features plans** unlock higher query limits, private dashboards, and greater customization options for advanced users, particularly useful for researchers and developers.

5. **Messari**:
   - **Free Tier**: Messari’s free tier provides limited access to crypto data and analysis, such as basic market insights and some reports .
   - **Paid Features**: Forled research, advanced analytics, and exclusive reports, Messari offers premium subscriptions. These are typically used by institutional investors and analysts.

- **Nansen** and **Messari** are particularly popular among institutional investors due to their advanced data features and research reports. 
- **DeBank** and **Zapper** are favored by DeFi enthusiasts for their user-friendly interfaces and portfolio tracking capabilities.
- **Dune Analytics** appeals to data-driven users and developers, especially those who are **comfortable with SQL and need deep access to blockchain data**.

For many casual users, **DeBank** and **Zapper** provide sufficient features, while **Nansen** and **Messari** are more suited for power users needing professional-grade analysis.

### Exploring Protocols

Solidity is not the only language you can use with Polygon. While it's the most popular language for developing smart contracts on Polygon due to its compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), other languages can be used indirectly.

{{< details title="Here are some other options 📌" closed="true" >}}

Indirectly through Compilation:

Vyper: A Python-like language that compiles to EVM bytecode, allowing you to write smart contracts in a more Pythonic style.   
Yul: A low-level assembly language for the EVM, which can be used for highly optimized or specific use cases.

{{< /details >}}





So if the Analytics part is clear...

...and blockchain data is public?

How about exploring one protocol as an example? 

> Let's give it a try to **PolyMarket**


* Its kind of a prediction market...place? Lets find out how many transactions are happening
  * https://defillama.com/protocol/polymarket#information
  * Transactions - https://polygonscan.com/txs?a=0x4bfb41d5b3570defd03c39a9a4d8de6bd8b8982e

{{< details title="About PolyMarket... 📌" closed="true" >}}


Polymarket Overview: **A decentralized application on the Polygon blockchain** for predicting real-world events like elections and sports.

Functionality: Users buy shares based on their predictions; share prices fluctuate with user confidence. Correct predictions yield profits, while incorrect ones result in losses.
Prediction Examples: Includes political outcomes (e.g., presidential elections) and pop culture events (e.g., TikTok's potential ban in the U.S.).
Liquidity Providers: Essential for market function; they deposit funds into a share pool and earn rewards, including weekly payouts in USDC.
Important Considerations:
    Not available in the U.S.; users should verify local laws.
    Distinction between actual probabilities and market opinions is crucial.
Key Takeaways:
    Users can profit from accurate predictions.
    Liquidity providers ensure market efficiency.
    Awareness of local regulations is necessary before participation.
