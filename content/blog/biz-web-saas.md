**TL;DR** 

Putting together a quick and OSS Template with [Astro/Flask/PB](#the-stack)

Because...we want to launch fast: *Would a simpler [SSG x PB SDK](#ssg-x-pb) work?*

**Intro**

* This is great for a personal portfolio https://free-astro-template.netlify.app/
    * https://github.com/guihubie/free-astro-template

But this is for a saas https://github.com/ctrimm/astro-payroll-solution-theme

> https://github.com/larry-xue/astro-sassify-template is also great as seen on this other post

The book a demo we already know how to do via `cal.com` or formbricks.

But how about having a SSG for content + real auth and different content for logged in users?

Has it come the moment to mix SSG with Flask or FastAPI?


## The Stack 

1. Python for BE, particularly FastAPI connected with PB
2. Astro to serve good looking static content

### FastAPI

If you create with Python, FastAPI is one of the ways to do webapps.

#### PocketBase Auth with FastAPI

```sh
export PB_URL="http://localhost:9000"
export TEST_EMAIL="test3@test.com"
export TEST_PASSWORD="testpasswd"
export TEST_NAME="Test User"

echo "üîß Testing Prompt Library API Endpoint"
echo "======================================"
echo "PocketBase URL: $PB_URL"
echo "FastAPI URL: $FASTAPI_URL"
echo "Test Email: $TEST_EMAIL"
echo ""

# Step 1: Create a test user
echo "üìù Step 1: Creating test user..."
USER_RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST "$PB_URL/api/collections/users/records" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
    \"email\": \"$TEST_EMAIL\",
    \"password\": \"$TEST_PASSWORD\",
    \"passwordConfirm\": \"$TEST_PASSWORD\",
    \"name\": \"$TEST_NAME\"
  }")

echo "üîë Step 2: Getting authentication token..."
TOKEN_RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST "$PB_URL/api/collections/users/auth-with-password" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d "{
    \"identity\": \"$TEST_EMAIL\",
    \"password\": \"$TEST_PASSWORD\"
  }")

echo "üîë Check that the token is valid..."
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN_RESPONSE" \
  "$PB_URL/api/health" | jq .

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN_RESPONSE" \
  "http://localhost:3900/api/v1/library-prompts/tree" | jq .

RESPONSE=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN_RESPONSE" \
  "http://localhost:3900/api/v1/library-prompts/tree")

echo $RESPONSE
```

### SSG

Lets use this cool astro theme: https://github.com/ctrimm/astro-payroll-solution-theme

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ctrimm/astro-payroll-solution-theme #MIT Licensed
#https://payflo.corytrimm.com/ #demo

npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4321 #http://192.168.1.11:4321/
```

Why is so cool?

1. Amazing Blog Post section with filter tags + Cool ToC
2. Login/Book a call buttons


#### SSG x PB

I was also reading, *chatting with Gemini*, that we could keep the good old stack

I mean: Cloudflare Pages + CF Workers + Fetch/Posts users/pwds from a pocketbase hosted somewhere...

Even pb can provide very nice authentication signin/up while the theme is on cloudflare pages.

CF Workers would be the one in charge to allow access to certain static paths like `/private` checking if the user is logged in or not

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/payroll-workers-pb/" title="Payroll Theme with PB as auth" image="/blog_img/apps/gh-jalcocert.svg" subtitle="Source Code Astro Theme + CF Workers + PB users collections as Auth" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

```sh
sudo apt install gh
gh auth login
gh repo create payroll-workers-pb --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

{{< callout type="info" >}}
A static Astro site adds auth by proxying login/logout and protected checks through Cloudflare Pages Functions, which **issue and validate an HttpOnly cookie** against PocketBase user records.
{{< /callout >}}

> > And I got auth via PB SDK working!

We should have a look to `/api/collections/users/auth-with-password`

Remember you have: https://pocketbase.io/demo/ But this wont give you API access.

The astro site will need to have the PB library so that the SDK is available:

```sh
npm i pocketbase
```

For this, we will need to have pocketbase up and running and then to provision a proper collection: `http://192.168.1.11:8080/api/health`

```sh
#npm i pocketbase
PB_URL=http://192.168.1.11:8080 \
PB_ADMIN_EMAIL="yourpbemail" \
PB_ADMIN_PASSWORD="yourpbadminpass" \
npm run provision:pb
```

> You could pass those via `.env` and then try to signup/in: `http://192.168.1.8:4321/signup`


{{< callout type="warning" >}}
With the local setup I *might have been* getting issues with the CORS: https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/discussions/606 or not having https
{{< /callout >}}

So first i tried it via MKCert and then i just I went quickly with my known [Cloudflare Tunnels](#cloudflare-workers-auth)

> With CF tunnels and the https it **worked fine**!

#### Cloudflare Workers Auth

You wont be able to use the demo PB API, so you will need to bring your PB publically + Cloudflare pages: *CF Pages configured, like [recently](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/serverless-invoices/blob/main/Deploy_to_CF.md)*

```sh
#npm run build
wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=fast-payroll-theme --branch=main
```

Remember to config the url for your CF worker:

![Cloudflare Workers configuration to PocketBase](/blog_img/dev/FE/cf-worker-config-to-pocketbase.png)

And to add your PB container into the **cloudflare tunnels network**:

```sh
docker network connect cloudflared_tunnel pocketbase
```

And now these will work:

* https://pocketbase.jalcocertech.com/api/health
* https://pocketbase.jalcocertech.com/_/

![SSG and CF Workers + Pocketbase](/blog_img/dev/FE/ssg-cfworkers-pocketbase.png)

This user has been created as per the **SSG and CF Workers interaction**:

![alt text](/blog_img/dev/FE/pb-created-user-via-ssg.png)

Once the `/signup` is actually sending the data to your PB instance (users collection), we can proceed.

How about using the login page of the theme, and allow you to see a new `/secret` page only if you are logged in with a mail and pass that is inside the PB collection?

If you are not logged in, you will be redirected towards `/login`.

Simple, static and **it literally flies:**

## Conclusions


{{< callout type="info" >}}
This theme has been great to work with and its a great candidate for landing pages and Micro SaaS
{{< /callout >}}

We could use any other combination of authentications, like: *LogTo, TinyAuth, just hardcoded...* I recapped recently on [this post](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/front-end-and-auth/#authentication-tools).

![Secret Page of the astro theme just for the users registered in the pockerbase collecion](/blog_img/dev/PB/pb-secret-page.png)

> This is how it looks the result: https://fast-payroll-theme.pages.dev/

Im now thinking that a future webifyer/*awebsiteforall* project could have such workflow: 

SSG -> PB signup/signin -> See the `/themes` page if logged in and then choose:

* Free Tier: Select theme -> Gitea replicate user/pwd -> markdown editor
* Paid Tier: Pay and get your own domain (check against stripe)
* Custom solutions

{{< callout type="info" >}}
For that some *kind of feature flags* will be required, probably something like [gofeatureflag](https://gofeatureflag.org/docs/sdk/client_providers/openfeature_javascript) combined with the described setup
{{< /callout >}}

As this has worked, so should a SSG + CF Worker + Logto via JS (instead of python):

* https://docs.logto.io/api-protection/nodejs
* https://www.npmjs.com/package/@logto/js

Im still impressed by **new CLI tools**, like

1. In case you need to bill someone, there is a new player in town: https://github.com/cemalidev/invocli

> A Node.js CLI for generating PDF invoices

> > Remember also about [serverless-invoices](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/serverless-invoices).

2. Cursor CLI

Some [**concepts** recap](#faq)

* A **callback** is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then executed at a later time.
* A **hook** is a specific type of callback that allows you to "tap into" or execute code at a predefined point in a system's execution flow.
* A **webhook** is a specific application of a hook for REST APIs, acting as an event-driven HTTP callback that sends real-time data to a client's URL when a specific event occurs.
* An **endpoint** is a specific URL in a REST API that represents a resource or a collection of resources, serving as the destination for client requests.

### Proper Tags

That's a great question, and there are several ways to tag your project, with the `v.breakingchange.feature.fix` format being a common approach. 

This is an example of **semantic versioning** and is widely used for version control.

**Semantic Versioning**

Semantic versioning, often shortened to SemVer, is a system that uses three numbers to represent the version of a software project: **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**.

It provides a clear way to communicate the type of changes that have been made in a new release.

* **MAJOR:** The first number is incremented when you make **breaking changes** that are incompatible with previous versions.
* **MINOR:** The second number is for new **features** that are backward-compatible.
* **PATCH:** The third number is for backward-compatible bug **fixes**.

For example, if you're on version `1.2.3`:

* A **bug fix** would change it to `1.2.4`.
* A new **feature** would change it to `1.3.0`.
* A **breaking change** would change it to `2.0.0`.

This system is very effective because it gives users and developers a clear understanding of the scope and potential impact of a new release without needing to read detailed release notes.


#### Additional Tags

You can add additional tags to provide more context. These are often used for pre-release versions.

* **`alpha`:** This indicates a very early, unstable version.
* **`beta`:** This is a more stable pre-release, often used for testing.
* **`rc`** (release candidate): This is a final test version before the official release.
* **`dev`** (development): This indicates a version that is actively being worked on.

For example, a pre-release version could be tagged as `1.4.0-beta.1`.

#### Using Your Proposed Format

Your proposed format, `v.breakingchange.feature.fix`, is a conceptual breakdown of the types of changes that would lead to a new version number in the **SemVer** system. 

It's not a standard tagging format itself but rather a good way to think about the reasons behind your versioning.

The actual tag you'd use for a new version with a breaking change, a new feature, and some fixes would be something like `v1.2.3` or `v2.0.0` depending on the changes.

Ultimately, the best tagging strategy depends on your project's needs and how you want to communicate with your users and collaborators. 

> However, adopting **SemVer** is a widely accepted and highly recommended practice.

## FAQ

A **hook is a type of callback**, but the two terms aren't interchangeable.

A callback is a general programming concept where you pass a function (or "callable") as an argument to another function, which then calls it at a later time.

> A hook is a specific type of callback used in certain software architectures, especially those that are event-driven or extensible.

### Understanding Callbacks

A **callback** is a fundamental programming pattern. 

It's essentially a function that's given to another function to be executed later.

The function receiving the callback is often a higher-order function.

This pattern is commonly used in asynchronous operations, like fetching data from a server, where you want to perform an action only after the data has been received.

Consider this simple example:

```javascript
function fetchData(url, callback) {
  // Simulate an asynchronous network request
  setTimeout(() => {
    const data = "Hello, world!";
    callback(data); // The callback function is called here
  }, 1000);
}

function processData(data) {
  console.log("Processing the data:", data);
}

// Pass processData as a callback to fetchData
fetchData("https://example.com/api/data", processData);
```

In this case, `processData` is the callback. 

It's passed to `fetchData` and is only executed after the simulated data has been "fetched."


### Understanding Hooks

A **hook**, on the other hand, is a specific implementation of the callback pattern.

Hooks are typically used in frameworks or applications that allow developers to **"hook into"** or "tap into" specific points in the system's execution flow.

They are essentially pre-defined callbacks that a system will invoke when a particular event occurs.

For example, in a content management system (CMS) like WordPress, there are many **action hooks** and **filter hooks**.

* **Action hooks** allow you to execute your own custom code at a specific point, such as when a new post is saved. You "hook" your function to that event.
* **Filter hooks** allow you to modify data before it's displayed or saved, such as filtering the content of a post before it's shown to a user.

A common example of hooks is in React. **React Hooks** like `useState` and `useEffect` are special functions that let you "hook into" React features from your functional components. 

For instance, `useEffect` allows you to hook into the component's lifecycle to perform side effects like data fetching or DOM manipulation.

**The Analogy**

Think of it this way: a **callback** is like giving a friend your phone number and asking them to call you back when they're ready to leave.

You've provided the mechanism for a future action.

A **hook** is more like a specific, pre-determined **"Do Not Disturb" sign** on a hotel room door.

The cleaning staff has a pre-defined process for checking doors, and when they encounter your sign, it **"hooks"** into their normal routine, causing them to skip your room.

The system (the cleaning staff's routine) has a designated point where it checks for and responds to your input (the hook).

In the context of REST APIs, the concepts of callbacks and hooks are used to enable **asynchronous communication** and **event-driven architecture**. 

While a traditional REST API operates on a simple request-response model (the client requests data and the server immediately responds), callbacks and hooks allow the API to notify the client about events that happen later, without the client needing to repeatedly ask for updates.


### Callbacks in REST APIs

A **callback** in a REST API is typically used for long-running, asynchronous operations.

Instead of the API server holding a connection open while it performs a task, the client sends a request that includes a special **callback URL**.

The server then immediately responds with a status like `202 Accepted`, acknowledging the request. When the long-running task is finally complete, the server makes a new HTTP request to the client's provided callback URL, sending the final result.

This is much more efficient than **polling**, where the client would have to repeatedly send requests to the server to check if the task is finished.

* **Example**: An e-commerce API might accept a request to generate a complex sales report. 

1. The client sends a `POST` request to `/reports` with a `callbackUrl` in the payload. The server immediately returns a `202` status. 
2. When the report is ready hours later, the server sends a `POST` request to the client's `callbackUrl` with the report data.

***

### Hooks in REST APIs (Webhooks)

A **hook** in the context of REST APIs is almost always referred to as a **webhook**.

A webhook is a mechanism that allows a **service to send real-time data to a client as soon as a specific event occurs**, without any prior request from the client.

The client, or "subscriber," provides a URL (the webhook URL) to which the "publisher" sends data.

Webhooks are a key component of an event-driven architecture.

They are essentially **user-defined HTTP callbacks** that are triggered by system-wide events.

**Example**: A GitHub API user can configure a webhook on their repository.

1. When a new commit is pushed, GitHub sends a `POST` request to the user's webhook URL with a JSON payload containing information about the commit.
2. The user's application can then process this data in real-time, perhaps by triggering an automated build process.

### Gitea 101

Gitea x GHA

With Github you can get GHA for free on public repos.

But how about **setting Github to Gitea webhooks** and then build your site on your homelab automatically?

What? What are the Directions?

> Webhooks are `Gitea -> Your service`.

> > To make things happen inside Gitea, you call its API `Your service -> Gitea`.


* Run Gitea into your HomeLab via: https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Home-Lab/tree/main/gitea

```sh
sudo docker compose up -d
```

And go to `localhost:3033` to see Gitea Web UI.


{{< callout type="info" >}}
Which it was a demostration of how the `depends_on` container feature works between containers and the compose overrides. See [these .md](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Home-Lab/tree/main/gitea)
{{< /callout >}}

*You know whats commin right?*

1. Deploy Gitea, create the admin and get its PAT - Get Familiar with [gitea API capabilities](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Home-Lab/blob/main/gitea/gitea-api.md)
2. As users can be created via API and they can fork repos...how about using some [html + FastAPI to wrap that](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Home-Lab/tree/main/gitea/user-creator-fastapi)?
3. Imagine...using gitea and cloning a public Github Repo, [like the one we talked above](#ssg)

```sh
curl -sS -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITEA_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "clone_addr": "https://github.com/ctrimm/astro-payroll-solution-theme.git",
    "repo_name": "astro-payroll-solution-theme",
    "mirror": false,
    "private": false,
    "description": "Imported from GitHub"
  }' \
  "$GITEA_BASE/repos/migrate?sudo=yosua" | jq '.full_name,.private,.mirror'
```

4. Then, continue developing a WebApp that would allow for logged in users to simply edit the content of that SSG (markdown editor)

5. When commit happens, a static build would be triggered via Webhook


See this sample [FastAPI + html](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Home-Lab/tree/main/gitea/user-creator-fastapi) that bundles of this:

### Gitea via CLI

How about doing cool stuff with Gitea, but **programatically**?

**Gitea has a cool API**

I mean a REST API, a type of API (Application Programming Interface): *interface to interact with a system‚Äôs capabilities.*
- Examples: REST over HTTP/JSON, GraphQL, gRPC, SOAP, WebSocket APIs, language SDKs, even CLIs.
- In your Gitea context:
  - ‚ÄúAPI‚Äù in <https://docs.gitea.com/api/1.24/> specifically means the **HTTP REST API (JSON over HTTP)**.
  - Your curl examples are REST calls to `http://.../api/v1/...`.
  - Webhooks are not you calling the API; they‚Äôre HTTP callbacks from Gitea to you.
    - And for these to work, *someone or something* should be listening

{{< /callout >}}

> If you want to dive deeper...*I have not yet*

**Gitea provides a built-in command-line tool** for administration tasks, including user management.

The command to create a new user is `gitea admin user create`.

You'll need to provide some required information like the username, password, and email.

You can also specify other options, such as making the new user an administrator.

Here's a general example of the command:

```bash
gitea admin user create --username myname --password asecurepassword --email me@example.com
```

If you want to create an admin user, you can add the `--admin` flag:

```bash
gitea admin user create --admin --username myadmin --password anothersafe_password --email admin@example.com
```

**Note:** The specific way you run this command may vary depending on your Gitea installation. 

For example, if you're running Gitea in a Docker container, you'll need to execute the command inside the container using `docker exec`.

### Cloning Repositories

Gitea is a Git server, so you use standard Git commands to interact with it. 

To clone a repository, you'll use the `git clone` command, just like you would with any other Git service (like GitHub or GitLab).

You'll need the repository's URL, which can be either an HTTPS or an SSH URL. 

You can find this URL on the Gitea web interface for the repository.

Here are examples for both methods:

**Using HTTPS:**

```bash
git clone https://gitea.example.com/username/repository.git
```

**Using SSH:**

```bash
git clone git@gitea.example.com:username/repository.git
```

Before you can clone via SSH, you'll need to have an SSH key added to your Gitea user account.
