- **Rule Tables:**
  - **Decision Tables:** The most common type, used for expressing rules with multiple conditions and actions.
  - **Decision Trees:** Visual representation of decision-making processes, often used for more complex rules.
  - **Spreadsheet-like Calculators:** For straightforward calculations and data manipulation.

- **Rule Structure:**
  - **Conditions:** The criteria that must be met for a rule to fire.
  - **Actions:** The steps taken when a rule is triggered.
  - **Return Values:** The output or result generated by a rule.

- **Rule Execution:**
  - **Rule Engine:** The component responsible for interpreting and executing rules based on input data.
  - **Rule Evaluation:** The process of determining whether a rule's conditions are met.
  - **Rule Firing:** The execution of a rule's actions when its conditions are satisfied.

- **Rule Management:**
  - **Rule Repository:** A centralized location for storing and managing rules.
  - **Rule Versioning:** Tracking changes to rules over time.
  - **Rule Deployment:** The process of making rules available for use in applications.

- **Integration:**
  - **API Integration:** Connecting OpenL Tablets to other systems or applications through APIs.
  - **Data Integration:** Importing and exporting data between OpenL Tablets and external sources.

- **Excel-based Development:**
  - **Excel Templates:** Pre-defined structures for creating rule tables.
  - **Excel Functions:** Using Excel functions within rule expressions.
  - **Excel Formatting:** Applying formatting to rule tables for better readability.

- **Business Rule Governance:**
  - **Rule Validation:** Ensuring the accuracy and consistency of rules.
  - **Rule Testing:** Verifying that rules function as intended.
  - **Rule Documentation:** Providing clear explanations and documentation for rules.
