Svelte y Astro son tecnolog√≠as frontend que comparten la prioridad por la velocidad y eficiencia, pero no son exactamente alternativas directas, ya que tienen enfoques y casos de uso diferentes.

Svelte es un framework que compila componentes a JavaScript muy optimizado en tiempo de construcci√≥n, lo que permite construir aplicaciones web interactivas, reactivas y complejas con alto rendimiento. SvelteKit, el framework oficial de Svelte, a√±ade funcionalidades completas para construir aplicaciones con routing, SSR (renderizado servidor) y otras caracter√≠sticas de apps modernas.

Astro, en cambio, es un framework orientado a sitios web con contenido m√°s est√°tico y enfoque en rendimiento extremo. Utiliza una arquitectura llamada "Island Architecture" que prerenderiza la mayor√≠a de la p√°gina en HTML est√°tico entregando muy poco JavaScript al navegador. Astro soporta usar componentes de m√∫ltiples frameworks como React, Vue o Svelte dentro de un mismo proyecto, priorizando la carga m√≠nima de scripts.

En resumen:
- Svelte (con SvelteKit) es m√°s adecuado para aplicaciones web interactivas y complejas.
- Astro es ideal para sitios de contenido est√°tico donde la optimizaci√≥n de carga y SEO es cr√≠tica.
- Astro puede incluir componentes Svelte para partes interactivas, h√≠brido que aprovecha ambos.

Por tanto, Svelte no es una alternativa directa a Astro; m√°s bien, Astro puede usar Svelte como parte de su stack, y SvelteKit compite con marcos orientados a SPAs y aplicaciones completas, mientras que Astro destaca en sitios est√°ticos y multi-framework.[1][2][5][6][7]

## Better Tech Stack

Because Im still in D&A and trying to blend with AI powered development for my personal projects.

2. Pocketbase for BaaS, and a much better understanding of authentication/authorization.

{{< details title="Authentication Flows Working | Example PB vs FastAPI üìå" closed="true" >}}

The key difference between PocketBase and a framework like FastAPI is the level of abstraction and the amount of manual coding required. 

PocketBase is a backend-as-a-service that handles the entire process for you, whereas FastAPI requires you to code each step.

Here is the combined explanation, comparing the authentication flow for both platforms, assuming your frontend is built with Astro.

1. Client Sends Credentials

The user enters their credentials on your login page. The Astro frontend sends a request to your backend.

  * **PocketBase**: The Astro frontend, using the PocketBase JavaScript SDK, makes a single, simple API call. The SDK abstracts the underlying `fetch` request, handling the correct endpoint and request body.
    ```javascript
    // Astro component with JS
    await pb.collection('users').authWithPassword(email, password);
    ```
  * **FastAPI**: Your Astro frontend must manually make a `fetch` request to your custom login endpoint. You are responsible for constructing the URL, body, and headers.
    ```javascript
    // Astro component with JS
    await fetch('http://127.0.0.1:8000/token', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: `username=${username}&password=${password}`
    });
    ```

2. Server Validates Credentials

The backend receives the request and verifies the credentials.

  * **PocketBase**: This step is entirely handled by PocketBase's core logic. The server automatically hashes the provided password and compares it to the hash stored in the `users` collection.
  * **FastAPI**: You must write the code to handle this logic. Using libraries like `passlib` for password hashing and an ORM like `SQLAlchemy` to query your SQLite database, your FastAPI endpoint would:
      * Query the database for the user by username.
      * Retrieve the stored hashed password.
      * Compare the user-provided password with the stored hash.


3. Server Issues the JWT

If the credentials are valid, the server creates and sends a **JWT bearer token** to the client.

  * **PocketBase**: PocketBase automatically generates a **JWT bearer token** with the user's information and a default expiration time. It returns this token in the API response without any manual coding.
  * **FastAPI**: You must manually generate the JWT. Using a library like `python-jose`, your endpoint would:
      * Create a payload with the user's ID and an expiration time.
      * Sign the payload with a secret key using an algorithm like **HS256**.
      * Return the generated token in the JSON response.

4. Client Stores and Uses the Token

The client-side code receives the token and uses it for future requests to protected endpoints.

  * **PocketBase**: The PocketBase SDK automatically stores the received token for you in local storage. For all subsequent requests, the SDK automatically includes the token in the `Authorization` header.
  * **FastAPI**: Your frontend code must manually parse the JSON response, save the token to local storage, and then retrieve it for every `fetch` request to a protected endpoint, manually adding it to the `Authorization` header.

5. Server Validates the Token and Authorizes Access

The backend validates the token and decides whether to grant access to the protected content.

  * **PocketBase**: This is handled automatically. When a request with a bearer token hits a protected collection endpoint, PocketBase automatically validates the token's signature, checks its expiration, and authorizes access based on the **API rules** you've set up in the admin dashboard.
  * **FastAPI**: You must write a **dependency** function that extracts the token from the header, validates it, and handles errors. You then add this dependency to every protected route.

In summary, PocketBase provides a high-level SDK that abstracts the entire process, making it a fast and convenient backend solution.

FastAPI gives you complete control and flexibility but requires you to build the authentication system yourself using third-party libraries and custom code.

{{< details title="And things can stay static | If you know about Cloudflare Workers üìå" closed="true" >}}

You can use Cloudflare Workers to act as a **reverse proxy** or a **smart router** that forwards requests to your PocketBase home server.

This is a common and highly effective pattern for self-hosting applications.

**The Role of Cloudflare Workers**

A Cloudflare Worker is a serverless function that runs on Cloudflare's global network, very close to your users.

It can intercept incoming traffic and perform logic on it before forwarding the request to your actual server.

When a user tries to access your app's domain, the request goes to the Cloudflare network first, not directly to your home server.

**The Authentication Flow with Workers**

1.  **Client Sends Credentials**: Your Astro frontend sends a request to your custom domain (e.g., `api.yourdomain.com`). This request hits the Cloudflare network.

2.  **Worker Intercepts Request**: Your Cloudflare Worker intercepts the request. Its code's primary job is to act as a **proxy**. It takes the incoming request and forwards it to your PocketBase server running on your home network. It adds the necessary headers and makes sure the connection is secure.

3.  **PocketBase Handles Authentication**: The request reaches your home server. PocketBase handles all the authentication logic as described previously: it validates the credentials, generates the JWT, and sends it back to the Worker.

4.  **Worker Forwards Response**: The Worker receives the response from your PocketBase server and sends it back to the client.

By using Cloudflare Workers and a service like **Cloudflare Tunnel**, you can expose your local PocketBase server to the internet without opening any ports on your home router.

Cloudflare Tunnel creates a secure outbound connection from your home server to the Cloudflare network, making your server accessible without exposing its IP address or creating security risks.

This is the **best practice** for self-hosting applications.

{{< /details >}}

3. Understanding that [with CSR we can](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/csr-and-js/) keep WebApps simple, yet providing interactivity via API where needed


{{< details title="Authentication and CSR | Full SelfHosting vs CF Pages + Workers  üìå" closed="true" >}}

Cloudflare Workers are **not a must**, but they are a very popular and recommended option for this setup. 

Your Astro site, once deployed to Cloudflare Pages, will be able to directly make API calls to your self-hosted PocketBase server.

Here's how this works and what changes in different scenarios.

**Cloudflare Pages and a Self-Hosted PocketBase**

When you deploy your Astro site to Cloudflare Pages, the static files are served globally from Cloudflare's CDN.

 However, your PocketBase server is still running on your home machine.

The key to connecting them is to make your PocketBase server accessible via a public URL. 

The easiest and most secure way to do this without a Worker is using **Cloudflare Tunnel**.

1.  **Cloudflare Tunnel**: You install the `cloudflared` daemon on your home server. This creates a secure, outbound connection (a "tunnel") to the Cloudflare network.
2.  **Public URL**: You configure the tunnel to route requests from a public domain (e.g., `api.yourdomain.com`) to your PocketBase server (e.g., `localhost:8090`).
3.  **Direct API Calls**: Your Astro site, deployed on Cloudflare Pages, will then make direct API calls to `https://api.yourdomain.com`. These requests travel securely through the Cloudflare network to your home server.

> In this scenario, Cloudflare Workers are not necessary for the authentication flow itself, as the requests are just being routed.

**If You're Self-Hosting the Astro Static Site**

If you self-host both the Astro static site and the PocketBase server, the process becomes even simpler.

Both services are running on the same machine, so you don't need a public tunnel or a Worker. The Astro frontend can make API calls to PocketBase using a **local URL** like `http://localhost:8090` or `http://127.0.0.1:8090`.

You would then use a web server like **Caddy** or **Nginx** to act as a reverse proxy. This single server would:

* Serve the Astro static files to the public.
* Proxy API requests from your Astro site to the PocketBase backend, all on the same machine.
* Handle HTTPS and other security concerns for both services.

This setup is the most straightforward for self-hosting but lacks the global performance benefits and DDoS protection that Cloudflare's network provides.

**Why You Might Still Use a Cloudflare Worker**

Even with Cloudflare Tunnel, you might still want to use a Cloudflare Worker for more advanced scenarios, such as:

* **Caching**: To cache API responses from your PocketBase server to improve performance and reduce the load on your home server.
* **Security**: To add an extra layer of security, like rate-limiting API requests or adding custom authentication checks before requests even reach your server.
* **Request Manipulation**: To modify incoming or outgoing requests and responses, for example, to hide your PocketBase URL or transform data.

{{% details title="API vs JWT vs OAUTh üöÄ" closed="true" %}}

Both a JWT bearer token and an API key can be used to authenticate against APIs and other services, but they work differently and offer varying security and flexibility. 

OAuth is a broader protocol for secure, delegated access and is often paired with JWT as the format for its access tokens.

- **API Key**:  
  - Simple method; a unique key is sent in requests to identify and authenticate the client.
  - Good for basic server-to-server scenarios, but offers limited security and control.[1][5]

- **JWT (JSON Web Token) Bearer Token**:  
  - A signed, encoded token conveying user identity and claims.
  - Used for stateless authentication; APIs verify the token‚Äôs signature without needing to consult a centralized database every time.
  - Efficient for distributed systems and microservices; commonly used in modern APIs.[5][1]

- **OAuth 2.0**:  
  - An authorization protocol that allows users to grant third-party applications delegated access to their data.
  - Handles complex permission scopes, third-party integrations, and user consent.
  - Often uses JWT tokens as the format for access tokens.
  - Strong security and control, but more complex to set up and manage, and better for scenarios requiring delegated access or SSO.[4][1][5]

Which Is Better?

- **API Key**: Best for simple authentication between trusted services, low-security or internal APIs.[1]
- **JWT**: Excellent for stateless authentication in scalable microservices; fast and efficient but lacks revocation and fine-grained permissions.[5][1]
- **OAuth (with JWT tokens)**: Ideal for complex scenarios requiring delegated authorization, third-party integrations, and robust security. Preferred for external/public APIs, especially those involving user data or multi-step permissions.[4][1][5]

**OAuth2.0 often uses JWT tokens as part of its workflow**, leveraging the strengths of both approaches for secure, scalable authentication and authorization.

For APIs exposed to external clients, OAuth is generally considered more secure and flexible. For internal use or single-service authentication, JWT and API keys are simpler.

{{< /details >}}

I mean...*Im almost there*

Now im aware of the **,business / product management trilema'**: *price vs customization vs performance/looks*


{{< details title="The business Trilema | Value Proposition üìå" closed="true" >}}

The trade-off you've described‚ÄîPrice vs. Customization vs. Performance/Looks‚Äîis a classic business and product management trilemma.

While it's not a formally named "entrepreneur's trilemma" in the same way as the "Project Management Triangle" (Time, Cost, Scope), it's a very real and fundamental set of choices that every entrepreneur and business owner has to make.

1. **You can't have it all.** The core idea of a trilemma is that you can't simultaneously maximize all three points of the triangle. To excel in one area, you will almost certainly have to compromise on one or both of the others.

2. **It defines your market position.** The way you prioritize these three factors determines your business model, target audience, and competitive strategy.
  
* **High Performance/Looks + High Customization + High Price:** This is the strategy for a luxury brand. Think of a custom-built sports car, bespoke clothing, or a high-end designer. You offer the best in quality and exclusivity, but it comes at a premium.

* **High Performance/Looks + Low Price + Low Customization:** This is the strategy of a mass-market, high-quality brand. Think of a popular smartphone manufacturer or a successful fashion brand. You offer a great-looking product that performs well, but you have to standardize it to keep costs down and sell at a lower price.

* **High Customization + Low Price + Lower Performance/Looks:** This is the strategy for businesses that cater to specific needs at an affordable price. Think of a local, family-run business that builds furniture to a customer's exact specifications, but might not have the high-tech machinery of a large factory. The product is unique and affordable, but perhaps not the sleekest or most durable on the market.

> This concept is closely related to the well-known "Good, Fast, Cheap" trilemma in [project management](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/selfhosting-pm-tools-docker/).

In that model, "Good" aligns with performance/looks and quality, "Fast" aligns with time to market, and "Cheap" aligns with price/cost.

The product-focused trade-offs you've outlined are an excellent way for an entrepreneur to **think about value proposition** and what they are truly offering to customers. 

It helps clarify what to build, who to sell it to, and what compromises are acceptable to achieve their vision.

Thats why I thought and do alot around [this web platform for creators](#launching-webifyer).


### Shipping Products


This year, It's been more building than shipping.

If you are successful, you will need to know [how to use Stripe API](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/using-stripe-with-flask/#stripe) and any form of invoicing customers:

#### Launching Webifyer

One of the skills I enjoy learning more is about photography.

And one of the of the best decisions I ever had, was to have a [Photo Blog](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/websites-themes-2024/).

> Now, you can also tell your story

Check how, *if you are passionate about Photography*

What is this all about?

Web templates (SSG'ed) connected to CMS's.

Because Selfhosting Static Generated Sites, is not a secret anymore:

{{< cards cols="1" >}}
  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Home-Lab/tree/main/ssg-astro" title="Astro SSG | Docker Config üêã ‚Üó" >}}
  {{< card link="https://github.com/ricsanfre/public-websites-docker" title="MIT | Selfhosting personal static websites with Traefik, private web analytics (matomo) and Remark42 for comments. üêã ‚Üó" >}}
{{< /cards >}}



But, time is money.

And you are loosing both without a proper website.

#### Leads and Offers

Linktree does things very well, yet cant compete with:

1. Domain 1sty free with CC required (This is a potential CAC)
2. abcd

Some people have been contacting me via EE registry `https://ariregister.rik.ee/eng/company/`

> Was wondering how were some EE business owner able to get my email?

> > They are getting kind of qualified leads (from users like me, who never actually subscribed...GDPR anyone?)

## Interesting Concepts

Concepts / ideas that I found during this year.

1. CYA (cover your ***) was always a thing. 

But [BRD/PRD/FRD](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/brd-vs-frd-for-data-analytics/) just takes it to the next level if you in PM/BA roles.

2. Its 2025 and now everyones says that it wants AI / [AI|BI](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/ai-bi-tools/) / AIOps / whatever. When it really needs [good'old ML](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/machine-learning-data-analytics/)

3. Declarative vs Procedural

* **Declarative Knowledge (Knowing *What*):** This is factual knowledge. It's about concepts, theories, principles, facts, definitions, and data. It's the "what" and "why" behind things.
    * *Examples:* Knowing the syntax of a programming language, understanding the principles of agile methodology, knowing the capital of France, recalling historical dates, understanding different economic theories.
* **Procedural Knowledge (Knowing *How*):** This is knowledge of how to perform a task or sequence of actions. It's the "how-to." It often involves skills, techniques, processes, and strategies.
    * *Examples:* Writing code in a programming language, facilitating a Scrum meeting, riding a bicycle, cooking a recipe, debugging software, performing a surgical procedure.

4. The woman in the red dress - Matrix

<!-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgJ5ZEn67tk -->
{{< youtube "YgJ5ZEn67tk" >}}

An example? 

Could [the aissistant](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Streamlit-AIssistant/tree/main) *from autumn 2024* have any additional feature?

Just not to *leave money on the table*?

> A person cant solve all problems (even less at the same time).

5. System > Goals

Which for me relates with: *More important than the willingness to win, is the willingnes to prepare.*

How would we reach our goals if we do nothing the move our current state closer to it? ah?

Kind of resonates with [process](#processes) > result.

> Systems *(designed for the worst days)* do not really on willpower / motivation

5. Quotes

> One place, not all over the place.

> *What are you afraid of loosing if you wont take any with you?*

> What worries you, **masters you**

> *Punishment fades but reward stayes*

> Freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one. [From Ghost CEO](https://john.onolan.org/12/), who [launched 12y ago](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform?ref=john.onolan.org).

> Data will say everything if we torture it long Enough. ~ [ML](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/machine-learning-data-analytics/) and Overfitting

> More important of the willingness to succeed is the willingness to prepare. ~ Do, do do, results *might* go later.

6. Guesstimates and [PostMortems](https://fernandocejas.com/blog/culture/2020-06-21-learn-out-of-mistakes-postmortems/)

7. Business/SaaS KPIs: CAC, EBITDA, LTV, NRR, MRR/ARR...

8. Mental **Obesity**. Which relates with bikeshedding and the [enless student syndrome](https://youtu.be/QFH-_exyNoo?si=yToM8KSBbT0V5xG3)

> Mental obesity (information vs execution) ig post

### Creating Tech Videos

Last year I set this as a goal.

What exactly were those **x24 tech videos** to make AI, automation and D&A more accesible: [x]

Along the way, Ive made my life easier by based the video content on a **simpler NEW repo**: https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Home-Lab 

1. [Cloudflare Tunnels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k75PviBQeA0)

I need to think whats next, bc fast fast fast content seem to rule: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yb4o2IwkqM

If this was too much content, you can always use a LLMs to summarize the YT Videos.

Like these ones: *or just use perplexity*

{{% details title="There are few youtube summarizers | projects üåç" closed="true" %}}

* https://github.com/jkawamoto/mcp-youtube-transcript

* https://github.com/DevRico003/youtube_summarizer

> MIT | A modern Next.js-based tool for AI-powered YouTube video summarization. This application allows you to generate concise summaries of YouTube videos using different AI models, with support for multiple languages and summary styles.

* https://github.com/Milkshiift/YouTubeTLDR

> MIT | ‚ö° A lightweight, self-hosted YouTube video summarizer with Gemini AI

{{% /details %}}

It was a year of a lot of applied AI

and understanding many concepts, like langflow, [langgraph](https://github.com/von-development/awesome-LangGraph)...


* https://platform.openai.com/docs/models
    * https://platform.openai.com/chat/edit?models=o1

The **CLI AI agents** have been a great part of this 2025:

{{< cards cols="1" >}}
  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Home-Lab/tree/main/codex-cli" title="Codex CLI | Docker Config üêã ‚Üó" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

Some of those CLI tools, like goose, provide also desktop app: *with linux version available!*

{{< cards cols="1" >}}
  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Home-Lab/tree/main/goose" title="Goose | Docker Config üêã ‚Üó" >}}
  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Home-Lab/tree/main/gemini-cli" title="Gemini CLI | Docker Config üêã ‚Üó" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

Some tools were CLI only, then released desktop version:

![Goose CLI UI](/blog_img/GenAI/goose-1.png)

![Goose Desktop - Plug a LLM and even provides transcription](/blog_img/GenAI/audio/goose-desktop.png)

> Additionally, I participated in ***few* tech Talks**:

1. Using LangChain to chat with a DB
2. Real Estate RAG
3. Vibe Coding a WebApp to make SliDev PPTs BA friendly

And extracted cool video metadata (gps / geolocation) from GoPros:

![GoPro Metadata Speed trackday](/blog_img/karting/gopro-gps-trackday-speed.png)


#### Other Videos

1. AI Powered [shorts](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/photo-video-tinkering/#ai-powered-shorts)

The TTS capabilities from these were also useful:

* https://aistudio.google.com/generate-speech
* https://platform.openai.com/audio/realtime

> I also came to know: https://github.com/speaches-ai/speaches which is *the ollama for TTS*

2. [ChartJS](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/line.html) Powered Shorts

https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/web-apps-with-flask/#about-chartjs

I also got to know about: https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html

3. Python powered YT Shorts - `@UnfoldingData` (PyFinance related via Matplotlib Animations)
3. RemotionJS / Animation powered

### Travel

Combining Tech and Travel to get the most out of them:

* https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/tech-for-a-trip/

### Note Taking

Is note taking a waste of time?

The time that you are writing notes / making your KB, you are not doing new things...

Is note taking just bike-shedding?

> I got to know about the concept during 2024

The power of notes. Without bikeshedding!


#### Dev Smart not Hard

Using AI to create more and better, in less time.

The so called, [vibe coding](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/vide-coding/).

With too many options: Repliit lovable [windsurf](https://windsurf.com/account/login) cursor bolt...

Even with: https://github.com/settings/copilot/features

> *El relato mata al dato* - Thats also true when looking for new project opportunities

1. Discovering uv as package manager and the power of makefile >>> readme.md code snippets was huge to me.
2. Git power: one action -> one commit + one branch -> one feature + main is the current AND ONLY reality

* See this for branching strategies: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/git-branching-guidance?view=azure-devops

3. No Nested if's, try -> Error exit with message

From all CMS that I tried on [this post](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/cms-for-static-websites/#frontmatter-cms), just frontmatter kept the simplicity I wanted.

But it does not bring the for all public admin UI.

Followed very closely by [Keystatic](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/cms-for-static-websites/#keystatic-cms).

The themes [landingpad](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/landingpad) and mizar helped a lot.

When you deploy the static site, the `whateverdomain.com/keystatic` path will still be there:

> But you wont be able to make any changes, as the server (Typescrypt API) is NOT running.


I also had the chance to work on D&A Prototypes, where I chose Streamlit as the way to present the PoC.

![Streamlit PyGWalker Rendered Map with locations](/blog_img/apps/streamlit/st_pygwalker_map.png)

That cool geomap was not included in the **S**cope **o**f **W**ork and a great surprise.

It was ofc properly documented on a KB during the transition phase.

> You could always use some static layout or wireframes before going to streamlit!

##### AI Stuff

You can make interesting conditional logic, like: *If scrap fails, send msg to telegram bot*

#### More Websites!

Other Websites Ive worked

  * https://ioracing-iotechcrafts.web.app/blog/unleashing-the-power-of-tailwind-css/

But for the ones who actually see value on them.


Btw, the **pages speed insights**, can be done via **API**: *see [this .md](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/morita-web/blob/main/z-pagespeedinsight-101.md)*

![Checking Google Pages Speed Insights Via API](/blog_img/web/morita-flask/pagespeedinsightapi.png)


Given the opportunity costs, something like: one time setup + pay less each consecutive year *if you stay quiet* could be interesting to improve client retention.

Or just [get the **web/ssg related ebook**](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/JAlcocerT/raw/main/Z_ebooks/web-ebook.pdf) if you are on a low budget and simply DIY.

```sh
#If you read me for long, you can simply generate it, its just consolidated notes knowledge :)
# From the repo root or from Z_ebooks/
Rscript Z_ebooks/render.R \
  --input Z_ebooks/web-ebook.md \
  --output Z_ebooks/web-ebook.pdf \
  --cover Z_ebooks/sample-cover.png

Better photo galleries, specially thanks to these components/shortcodes recap.

Still, far from: https://antfu.me/posts/photos-page, speciially: https://antfu.me/photos

Logto had a cool post about how to vibe code a photo gallery app with built in auth:

I even created skeleton (and videos) for web oriented to podcasts and ebooks.

> Maybe you can become some with a very personal blog, like [Sivers](https://sive.rs/about)

Still im far from this one: https://newsletter.marclou.com/p/my-solopreneur-story-0-to-65k-month-in-2-years or https://mfyz.com/moved-blog-from-wordpress-to-astro/

And having nice **hugo/astro directory pages** would be amazing.

Sth like: https://github.com/masterkram/minted-directory-astro, where you can easily plug some kind of DB/Sheet/Github repo readme's with particular front matter and get a website going.


#### Better Social Media

I improved the video workflow and tried superfially Postiz for sharing.

Also with some AI help, I vibed coded a webapp to help me with the youtube tech scripts content and audio.

And...well, some Flask automatic and high SNR content creation for twitter/X

### Improving the HomeLab

I am very happy to have discovered AppImageLauncher.

Thanks to it I got HTTPie Desktop, Cursor and marktext desktop apps working very quickly.

Ive had time to write few posts about **making selfhosting better**.

Together with a better, NEW and more organized repository:

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/astro-web-setup/" title="Trip Planner Post" image="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Py_Trip_Planner/raw/main/images/trip-planner-main-graph.png" subtitle="Weather Trends with Python" >}}
  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Home-Lab" title="NEW HomeLab Repo" image="/blog_img/apps/gh-jalcocert.svg" subtitle="Docker Configs and scripts for HOMELAB - Superseeds Docker repo" >}}
{{< /cards >}}
  
That one I want to keep the configurations minimalistic and very simple to replicate.

Ive been taking **inspiration from**:

Thanks to this sites, I get to know more cool apps:

## Conclusions

There was even time to make **[Data Analytics](#da-tech-stack) recaps** and create (not that much ship) [***better* SaaS products**](#shipping-products).


```mermaid
pie title DB MTB Expenses
         "Addons" : 500
         "Maintenance" : 1080
         "Insurance" : 865
         "Price" : 1100
```

I havent measure these blog posts time creation.

But it must have been sth like:

{{< /cards >}}


### D&A Tech Stack

I needed to improve my data analytics stack.

Because agents are coming for [*our* jobs](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/when-to-apply-for-a-job/): `https://jobforagent.com/`. *The 1st job board for autonomous AI agents* 

Normally withing D&A, you will have a rol to understand `the what` and figure our `the how` to get there.

The closer you are to the product/leadership team, the closer you will/should see `the why`.

And definitely, despite working with a laptop, **the D&A jobs are quite different to the pure development jobs.**

Well...

Some creative people have figured out a way to build *(beautiful)* websites from SQL, just [like this](https://github.com/sqlpage/SQLPage/tree/main/examples/official-site)

* https://github.com/sqlpage/SQLPage

> MIT | Fast SQL-only data application builder. Automatically build a UI on top of SQL queries.

> > In theory it can also be [selfhosted as per this guide](https://sql-page.com/your-first-sql-website/nginx.sql)

https://youtube.com/shorts/crZalY8oxyw?si=ZEbnZ0UC4M347Fj0


Its just... (OLAP ~ D&A) vs (OLTP ~ CRUD).

> Didnt your head just exploted ü§Ø? Same tools, different way to use them

When building Saas, you wear this kind of cap and go for the typical OLTP DB design for writes:

{{< tweet user="levelsio" id="1963709732432248998" >}}

When doing D&A, you go for the opposite, **quick read speeds**.


### For Next year...

#### Keep Doing

1. Vibe Coding and BiP *using what I already know is enought to build a lot of projects*
2. Sharing what I know with people around me. In person.
3. Shipping more Serverless / CSR / Static
4. Slowly getting better at action cam videos and ffmpeg / kdenlive. Just for fun.

5. Reading from time to time, people that inspires

* https://blog.cavelab.dev/2022/01/a-person-that-writes/


* <https://Selfhosted.show>
* <https://selfh.st/>

6. Keep writting, but less and more quality
7. Get better at Writting ebooks


#### Stop Doing

1. Opening more and more a shallow tech stack. *12/24 <<<150+ yearly posts on this blog should be more than enough*
2. Keeping 50+ tabs on chrome. *Not watching content on the phone and commet for summaries should help*.


#### Start Doing

1. Promoting what I do via youtube/jalcocertech.com/fossengineer. *Curated niche posts, expanding knowledge I already gained here*
2. Share interesting animations as a code on reddit/twitter/whatever forums. Its not ycombinator, nor producthunt but its sth
2. x30>x24 youtube tech videos, more elaborated, *probably without AI voice*
3. Go all-in to find new clients

**Maybe's**

Get in shape: *there are few projects available, so no excuse this time*

1. https://github.com/vanalmsick/workout_challenge

2. https://github.com/Snouzy/workout-cool?

> MIT |  üèã Modern open-source fitness coaching platform. Create workout plans, track progress, and access a comprehensive exercise database.
