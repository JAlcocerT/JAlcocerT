Contact forms (QR), waiting lists (like the one of astro-nomy theme) and business cards..

Some people have been contacting me via EE registry https://ariregister.rik.ee/eng/company/

Was wondering how were they able to get my email?

### Launching Webifyer

One of the skills I enjoy learning more is about photography.

One of the best decisions I ever had was to have a Photo Blog.

> Now you can also tell your story

Check how, *if you are passionate about Photography*

Web templates (SSG'ed) connected to CMS's.

Because Selfhosting Static Generated Sites, is not a secret anymore:

#### Leads and Offers

Linktree does things very well, yet cant compete with:


1. Domain 1sty free with CC required (This is a potential CAC)
2. abcd

## Interesting Concepts

1. CYA was always a thing. But [BRD/PRD/FRD](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/brd-vs-frd-for-data-analytics/) just takes it to the next level.

2. Its 2025 and now everyones says that it wants AI / [AI|BI](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/ai-bi-tools/) / AIOps / whatever. When it really needs [good'old ML](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/machine-learning-data-analytics/)

3. Declarative vs Procedural

* **Declarative Knowledge (Knowing *What*):** This is factual knowledge. It's about concepts, theories, principles, facts, definitions, and data. It's the "what" and "why" behind things.
    * *Examples:* Knowing the syntax of a programming language, understanding the principles of agile methodology, knowing the capital of France, recalling historical dates, understanding different economic theories.
* **Procedural Knowledge (Knowing *How*):** This is knowledge of how to perform a task or sequence of actions. It's the "how-to." It often involves skills, techniques, processes, and strategies.
    * *Examples:* Writing code in a programming language, facilitating a Scrum meeting, riding a bicycle, cooking a recipe, debugging software, performing a surgical procedure.

4. The woman in the red dress - Matrix

<!-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgJ5ZEn67tk -->
{{< youtube "YgJ5ZEn67tk" >}}

5. Quote

> *What are you afraid of loosing if you wont take any with you?*

6. Guesstimates

7. Business KPIs: CAC, EBITDA, LTV, NRR,...

An example? 

Could [the aissistant](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Streamlit-AIssistant/tree/main) have any additional feature not to *leave money on the table*?

8. Mental **Obesity**. Which relates with bikeshedding and the [enless student syndrome](https://youtu.be/QFH-_exyNoo?si=yToM8KSBbT0V5xG3)

### Note Taking

Is note taking a waste of time?

The time that you are writing notes, you are not doing new things...

Is note taking just bike-shedding?

> I got to know about the concept during 2024

The power of notes. Without bikeshedding!

## Conclusions

There was even time to make **Data Analytics recaps** and create/**ship better products**.

### D&A Tech Stacks

**Examples of Tech Stacks:**

* **Databricks + S3:**
    * This is a common cloud-based stack. Databricks provides the processing power (Spark), and S3 serves as the scalable data lake.

* **MinIO + Apache Iceberg + Nessie:**
    * This stack focuses on open-source technologies. MinIO provides object storage, Iceberg enables efficient data lake management, and Nessie adds version control (and time travel)

{{< details title="Nessie and Apache Iceberg 📌" closed="true" >}}

You're absolutely right. Project Nessie and Apache Iceberg are designed to work very well together, and Nessie can indeed be used on top of Iceberg. Here's a breakdown of their relationship:

* **Apache Iceberg:**
    * This is a table format for massive analytic datasets. It brings table-like capabilities to data lakes, enabling features like ACID transactions, schema evolution, and time travel.
    * Essentially, Iceberg helps organize your data lake into tables that behave more like traditional database tables.
* **Project Nessie:**
    * Nessie provides Git-like version control for your data lake. It allows you to create branches, commits, and tags for your data, making it easier to manage changes and collaborate.
    * In the context of Iceberg, Nessie acts as a catalog that tracks the metadata of your Iceberg tables. This allows you to version the state of your tables, not just the underlying data files.

**How They Work Together:**

* Nessie enhances Iceberg by providing a way to manage the metadata of Iceberg tables. This means you can:
    * Create branches to experiment with data transformations without affecting the production data.
    * Roll back to previous versions of your tables if needed.
    * Collaborate with others by merging changes from different branches.

{{< /details >}}

> In essence, Iceberg provides the table format, and Nessie provides the version control layer on top of those tables. This combination creates a powerful and flexible **data lakehouse architecture**.

* **HDFS + PySpark:**
    * This is a more traditional big data stack, often used in on-premises deployments. HDFS stores the data, and PySpark allows for Python-based data processing.


It's true that data analytics tech stacks can vary widely, and the examples you provided are all relevant.

Here's a breakdown of **typical components** and how they fit together:

**Core Components of a Data Analytics Tech Stack:**

* **Data Storage:**
    * This is where the raw and processed data resides. Common options include:
        * **Cloud Storage:** Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage (GCS), Azure Blob Storage. These are highly scalable and cost-effective.
        * **Data Lakes:** HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), which is often used in on-premises or hybrid environments.
        * **Data Warehouses:** Snowflake, Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift. These are optimized for analytical queries.
        * **Object Storage:** MinIO, which is an open source object storage solution that is S3 API compatible.
* **Data Processing:**
    * These tools transform and prepare data for analysis:
        * **Apache Spark:** A powerful distributed processing engine used for large-scale data transformation and analysis.
        * **Databricks:** A cloud-based platform built on Apache Spark, providing a collaborative environment for data engineering, data science, and machine learning.
        * **SQL-based tools:** These are essential for querying and manipulating data in data warehouses.
* **Data Orchestration:**
    * These tools manage the flow of data through the pipeline:
        * **Apache Airflow:** A platform for programmatically authoring, scheduling, and monitoring workflows.
        * **dbt (data build tool):** A transformation tool that enables data analysts and engineers to transform data in their data warehouses more effectively.
* **Data Catalog and Governance:**
    * These tools help manage and govern data assets:
        * **Apache Iceberg:** An open table format for large analytic datasets.
        * **Project Nessie:** Provides Git-like capabilities for data lakes.
        * **Apache Hive Metastore:** A central repository for metadata.
* **Data Visualization and Business Intelligence (BI):**
    * These tools allow users to explore and visualize data:
        * **Tableau, Power BI, Looker:** Popular BI platforms for creating dashboards and reports.

**Key Considerations:**

* The choice of tech stack depends on factors such as:
    * The volume and velocity of data.
    * The specific analytical needs of the organization.
    * Budget constraints.
    * Whether the deployment is on-premises, cloud-based, or hybrid.
