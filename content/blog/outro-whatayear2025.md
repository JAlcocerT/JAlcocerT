**Intro**

This year is been like a lot of [do](https://nav.al/do)

![Me during Y2025](/img/kitten-cat.gif#center)

{{< callout type="info" >}}
After [Weather Planning](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/trip-planner-with-weather/), there is also the **financial aspects of travelling**

**From last year...**

1. Get few more websites going for close people ✅ 
2. Leveraging on AI ✅ *Using Windsurf and Cursor*
3. Doing less in total and more of what has a real impact

{{< /details >}}





## Better Tech Stack

1. uv package manager and Makefiles

2. Pocketbase for BaaS

3. Understanding that with CSR I can keep WebApps simple, yet providing interactivity via API

4. I even got time to clean the IoT/MQTT with micro-controllers :)

5. And tinker a bit with [Crypto](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/understading-crypto-with-ai)

{{< details title="Crypto is...back? Electrum 📌" closed="true" >}}

> A recap on [BlockChain](https://simplyexplained.com/videos/how-does-a-blockchain-work/)

With KYC both: Binance and Kraken worked fine to me.

> > No keys, no coins - Make sure you understand how wallets work. 

```sh
flatpak install flathub org.electrum.electrum #BTC

flatpak install flathub org.featherwallet.Feather #Monero
#flatpak install flathub org.getmonero.Monero
```

If you ge a Metamask wallet for Ethereum, you can make [a Web3](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/guide-web3/)

{{< /details >}}

6. On the server/homelab side of the things...


{{< details title="FY24 vs FY25 | HomeLab 📌" closed="true" >}}



{{< /details >}}

7. Im still in [D&A](#da-tech-stack) and have take time to sharpen my big data knowledge.





## Entrepreneuring


* https://fossengineer.com/open-source-invoice-creator/

Contact forms (QR), waiting lists (like the one of astro-nomy theme) and business cards..

Some people have been contacting me via EE registry https://ariregister.rik.ee/eng/company/

> Was wondering how were some EE business owner able to get my email?

### Launching Webifyer

One of the skills I enjoy learning more is about photography.

One of the best decisions I ever had was to have a [Photo Blog](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/websites-themes-2024/).

> Now you can also tell your story

Check how, *if you are passionate about Photography*

Web templates (SSG'ed) connected to CMS's.

Because Selfhosting Static Generated Sites, is not a secret anymore:

* https://github.com/ricsanfre/public-websites-docker

> MIT |  Selfhosting personal static websites using private web analytics and comments platforms 

#### Leads and Offers

Linktree does things very well, yet cant compete with:

1. Domain 1sty free with CC required (This is a potential CAC)
2. abcd

## Interesting Concepts

Concepts / ideas that I found during this year.

1. CYA (cover your ***) was always a thing. 

But [BRD/PRD/FRD](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/brd-vs-frd-for-data-analytics/) just takes it to the next level.

2. Its 2025 and now everyones says that it wants AI / [AI|BI](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/ai-bi-tools/) / AIOps / whatever. When it really needs [good'old ML](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/machine-learning-data-analytics/)

3. Declarative vs Procedural

* **Declarative Knowledge (Knowing *What*):** This is factual knowledge. It's about concepts, theories, principles, facts, definitions, and data. It's the "what" and "why" behind things.
    * *Examples:* Knowing the syntax of a programming language, understanding the principles of agile methodology, knowing the capital of France, recalling historical dates, understanding different economic theories.
* **Procedural Knowledge (Knowing *How*):** This is knowledge of how to perform a task or sequence of actions. It's the "how-to." It often involves skills, techniques, processes, and strategies.
    * *Examples:* Writing code in a programming language, facilitating a Scrum meeting, riding a bicycle, cooking a recipe, debugging software, performing a surgical procedure.

4. The woman in the red dress - Matrix

<!-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgJ5ZEn67tk -->
{{< youtube "YgJ5ZEn67tk" >}}

An example? 

Could [the aissistant](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Streamlit-AIssistant/tree/main) have any additional feature?

Just not to *leave money on the table*?

> A person cant solve all problems (even less at the same time).

5. System > Goals

Which for me relates with: *More important than the willingness to win, is the willingnes to prepare.*

How would we reach our goals if we do nothing the move our current state closer to it? ah?

Kind of resonates with [process](#processes) > result.

5. Quotes

> One place, not all over the place.

> *What are you afraid of loosing if you wont take any with you?*

> *Punishment fades but reward stayes*

6. Guesstimates and [PostMortems](https://fernandocejas.com/blog/culture/2020-06-21-learn-out-of-mistakes-postmortems/)

7. Business KPIs: CAC, EBITDA, LTV, NRR,...

8. Mental **Obesity**. Which relates with bikeshedding and the [enless student syndrome](https://youtu.be/QFH-_exyNoo?si=yToM8KSBbT0V5xG3)

> Mental obesity (information vs execution) ig post

From the podcast: How to grow from doing hard things ( Huberman Lab x  Michael Easter) https://open.spotify.com/episode/6EDcPmRd6HHh2zdDnapEFS

9. Time is the currency of life

10. Authenticity is how you behave when you have no risk of punishment

11. Some *unrelated* blog & posts:

### Creating Tech Videos

Last year I set this as a goal.

What exactly were those 24 tech videos to make AI, D&A more accesible: [x]

Along the way, Ive made my life easier by based the video content on a simpler NEW repo: https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Home-Lab

{{< /cards >}}

> Additionally, I participated in *few* tech Talks

1. Using LangChain to chat with a DB
2. Real Estate RAG

### Other Videos

1. AI Powered [shorts](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/photo-video-tinkering/#ai-powered-shorts)

The TTS capabilities from these were also useful:

* https://aistudio.google.com/generate-speech
* https://platform.openai.com/audio/realtime

> I also came to know: https://github.com/speaches-ai/speaches which is *the ollama for TTS*

2. [ChartJS](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/line.html) Powered Shorts

3. Python powered YT Shorts - @UnfoldingData (PyFinance related via Matplotlib Animations)
3. RemotionJS / Animation powered

### Travel

Combining Tech and Travel to get the most out of them:

* https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/tech-for-a-trip/

### Note Taking

Is note taking a waste of time?

The time that you are writing notes, you are not doing new things...

Is note taking just bike-shedding?

> I got to know about the concept during 2024

The power of notes. Without bikeshedding!


### Dev Smart not Hard

Using AI to create more and better, in less time.

The so called, [vibe coding](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/vide-coding/)

> *El relato mata al dato* - Thats also true when looking for new project opportunities

1. Discovering uv as package manager and the power of makefile >>> readme.md code snippets was huge to me.
2. Git power: one action -> one commit + one branch -> one feature + main is the current AND ONLY reality

* See this for branching strategies: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/git-branching-guidance?view=azure-devops

3. No Nested if's, try -> Error exit with message


#### AI Stuff

* https://financemotion.pages.dev/ 

#### Better Social Media

With better video workflow and Postiz for sharing.

### Improving the HomeLab

Ive had time to write few posts about making your selfhosting better.

Together with a better and more organized repository:

## Conclusions

There was even time to make **[Data Analytics](#da-tech-stack) recaps** and create (not that much ship) [***better* SaaS products**](#shipping-products).


### D&A Tech Stack

I needed to improve my data analytics stack.

Because agents are coming for our jobs: `https://jobforagent.com/`. *The 1st job board for autonomous AI agents*

5. Table Format & Catalog 📋

Apache Iceberg and Project Nessie are key components of a modern, open-source data lakehouse architecture. They don't fit neatly into the previously defined categories because they represent a different layer of the stack: **the table format and the catalog**.


This category compares the tools that bring structure, transactions, and version control to a data lake.

| Criterion | **Apache Iceberg** | **Project Nessie** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type** | Open-source **Table Format** | Open-source **Data Catalog** |

{{< details title="Nessie and Apache Iceberg were really cool 📌" closed="true" >}}

Project Nessie and Apache Iceberg are designed to work very well together, and Nessie can indeed be used on top of Iceberg. 

* **Apache Iceberg:**
    * This is a table format for massive analytic datasets. It brings table-like capabilities to data lakes, enabling features like ACID transactions, schema evolution, and time travel.
    * Essentially, Iceberg helps organize your data lake into tables that behave more like traditional database tables.
* **Project Nessie:**
    * Nessie provides Git-like version control for your data lake. It allows you to create branches, commits, and tags for your data, making it easier to manage changes and collaborate.
    * In the context of Iceberg, Nessie acts as a catalog that tracks the metadata of your Iceberg tables. This allows you to version the state of your tables, not just the underlying data files.

**How They Work Together:**

* Nessie enhances Iceberg by providing a way to manage the metadata of Iceberg tables. This means you can:
    * Create branches to experiment with data transformations without affecting the production data.
    * Roll back to previous versions of your tables if needed.
    * Collaborate with others by merging changes from different branches.

> In essence, Iceberg provides the table format, and Nessie provides the version control layer on top of those tables. 

> > This combination creates a powerful and flexible **data lakehouse architecture**.

* **HDFS + PySpark:**
    * This is a more traditional big data stack, often used in on-premises deployments. HDFS stores the data, and PySpark allows for Python-based data processing.

* **Databricks + S3:**
    * This is a common cloud-based stack. Databricks provides the processing power (Spark), and S3 serves as the scalable data lake.

* **MinIO + Apache Iceberg + Nessie:**
    * This stack focuses on open-source technologies. MinIO provides object storage, Iceberg enables efficient data lake management, and Nessie adds version control (and time travel)

{{< details title="Core Components of a Data Analytics Tech Stack 📌" closed="true" >}}

* **Data Storage:**: This is where the raw and processed data resides. Common options include:
    * **Cloud Storage:** Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage (GCS), Azure Blob Storage.
        *  These are highly scalable and cost-effective **object stores** that serve as the foundation of cloud-native **data lakes**.
        * **Object Storage:** MinIO, which is an open source object storage solution that is S3 API compatible.
    * **Data Lakes:** HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), which is often used in on-premises or hybrid environments.
        * You will find format like: `avro`, `parquet` and `delta`.
    * **Data Warehouses:** Snowflake, Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift or Azure Synapse. These are optimized for analytical queries.

* **Data Processing:**  These tools transform and prepare data for analysis:
    * **Apache Spark:** A powerful distributed processing engine used for large-scale data transformation and analysis. It includes modules like **Spark SQL** for structured data, **Spark Streaming** for real-time data, and **MLlib** for machine learning.
    * **Databricks:** A cloud-based platform built on Apache Spark, providing a collaborative environment for data engineering, data science, and machine learning. 
        * It also offers features like **Delta Lake** for data reliability and **MLflow** for managing the machine learning lifecycle.
    * **SQL-based tools:** These are essential for querying and manipulating data in data warehouses. This category includes modern tools that use SQL for transformations:
        * **dbt (data build tool):** A transformation tool that enables data analysts and engineers to transform data in their data warehouses more effectively. It allows for modular SQL code and follows software engineering best practices.
            * Dbt wont move the data for you, so you need an orchestration tool like ADF or TalenD
        * **Dataform:** Google's equivalent of dbt, used for transforming data in BigQuery using **SQLX**.

* **Data Orchestration:**
    * These tools manage the flow of data through the pipeline:
        * **Apache Airflow:** A platform for programmatically authoring, scheduling, and monitoring workflows.
            * It defines pipelines as **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**.
        * **Cloud Composer:** Google Cloud's fully managed version of Apache Airflow, which simplifies its deployment and management.
        * **Azure Data Factory (ADF):** Microsoft's visual ETL and orchestration service, offering a code-free approach to building data pipelines within the Azure ecosystem.

* **Data Catalog and Governance:** These tools help manage and govern data assets:
    * **Apache Iceberg:** An open table format for large analytic datasets. It provides features like **ACID transactions**, schema evolution, and time travel.
        * See also Delta Lake Format: https://delta.io/ which is some kind of .parquet with enhance time travel capabilities
    * **Project Nessie:** Provides **Git-like capabilities** (branches, commits, tags) for data lakes, working in conjunction with table formats like Apache Iceberg to provide full data versioning and governance.
    * **Apache Hive Metastore:** A central repository for metadata, primarily used in the Hadoop ecosystem. It stores schema and location information for Hive tables.

```py
df = spark.read 
    .format("delta")
    .option("timestampAsOf", "2025-12-01") 
    .load("/path/to/my/table") 
```

* **Data Visualization and Business Intelligence (BI):**
    * These tools allow users to explore and visualize data:
        * **Tableau, Power BI, Looker:** Popular BI platforms for creating dashboards and reports.

**Key Considerations:**

* The choice of tech stack depends on factors such as:
    * The volume and velocity of data.
    * The specific analytical needs of the organization.
    * Budget constraints.
    * Whether the deployment is on-premises, cloud-based, or hybrid.
