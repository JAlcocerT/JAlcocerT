### LangFlow

Langflow is designed to redefine the boundaries of AI development in experimentation and real-world scenarios.

Its a lowcode **visual framework** for building multi-agent and RAG applications.

It's open-source, Python-powered, fully customizable, model and vector store agnostic.

It is **based on Python**, which makes it ready to have many integrations:

**LangFlow Embedded**

You can embedd langflow in your websites with few lines of JS and this project: https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow-embedded-chat

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Dont confuse LangFlow with LangFuse nor MLFlow
{{< /callout >}}

These other 2 are used for:

1. MLflow is an open-source platform to manage the complete machine learning lifecycle, including experiment tracking, model versioning, deployment, and providing integrated observability features, especially for LLM-powered applications.

2. Langfuse is an open-source observability platform specifically designed for LLM applications, offering detailed tracing, monitoring, and analytics to help developers understand, debug, and improve their language model-based systems.

#### TG Bots

3. Telegram...bots?


Sometime ago I was doing some tests with [tg bots](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Private/tree/main/Web_scrapping/Py_BeautifulSoup/TelegramBot), but that was all before the LLM boom.

And definitely there are interesting bots outthere, like the bibliotecasecreta.nl
* https://core.telegram.org/bots/api
  * https://pypi.org/project/python-telegram-bot/
  * https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot
  * https://docs.python-telegram-bot.org/en/stable/telegram.ext.application.html

```sh
pip install python-telegram-bot==22.0
```

{{< callout type="info" >}}
It was about time to make [a project again with a telegram bot](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/EntreAgujayPunto/tree/main/TelegramBot) üíª (combined with [web](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/websites-themes-2024/)!)
{{< /callout >}}

Its all done with Python and the following structure:

{{< filetree/container >}}
  {{< filetree/folder name="TelegramBot" >}}
    {{< filetree/file name=".dockerignore" >}}
    {{< filetree/file name=".env" >}}
    {{< filetree/file name=".env.sample" >}}
    {{< filetree/file name="Dockerfile" >}}
    {{< filetree/folder name="Z_Tests" state="closed" >}}
      {{< filetree/file name="tg_bot_image5.py" >}}
      {{< filetree/file name="z_tg_bot_botchatero.py" >}}
    {{< /filetree/folder >}}
    {{< filetree/file name="docker-compose.yml" >}}
    {{< filetree/file name="readme.md" >}}
    {{< filetree/file name="requirements.txt" >}}
    {{< filetree/file name="tg_bot_agujapunto.py" >}}
    {{< filetree/folder name="tgbot_image_venv" state="closed" >}}
      {{< filetree/file name="lib/python3.10/site-packages/..." >}}
    {{< /filetree/folder >}}
    {{< filetree/folder name="tgbot_venv" state="closed" >}}
      {{< filetree/file name="lib/python3.10/site-packages/..." >}}
    {{< /filetree/folder >}}
  {{< /filetree/folder >}}
{{< /filetree/container >}}

With a `.env` file like this one:

```
BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
CHAT_ID=YOUR_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID_HERE
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE
```

{{< details title="Setup a TG Bot | BotFather and API Tokens üìå" closed="true" >}}

* Open the **Telegram** app and search for the "BotFather" user.
* Start a chat with BotFather and use the `/newbot` command to create a new bot.
* Name your bot: *botwithuniquename*
* The bot will be `botwithuniquename_bot` -> <https://t.me/botwithuniquename_bot>
* Follow the instructions to set a name and username for your bot.
* Once the bot is created, BotFather will provide you with an **API token**.
  *  Save this token; you'll need it in your Python code.

with **/token** you can change the token:

{{< /details >}}

With the API token, you can use this token to access the HTTP API for your new bot.

![Bot Father](/blog_img/dev/tg-botfather.png)

{{< details title="Telegram Bots in groups üìå" closed="true" >}}

You can definitely create a group in Telegram and add both regular users and bots to it.**

Here's how you would typically do it:

1.  **Create a New Group:**
    * Open your Telegram app.
    * Tap the "New Message" icon (usually a pencil in a circle).
    * Select "New Group".

2.  **Add the First Regular User:**
    * Telegram will ask you to select the first member for your group. Choose one of the regular users you want to include.
    * Tap "Next" (or a similar button).

3.  **Name Your Group:**
    * Give your group a name.
    * You can also set a group photo if you like.
    * Tap "Create" (or a similar button).

4.  **Add the Second Regular User:**
    * Once the group is created, open the group chat.
    * Tap on the group name at the top to view the group info.
    * Look for an option like "Add members" or a "+" icon.
    * Select the second regular user you want to add and tap "Add".

5.  **Add Your Bot:**
    * In the same "Add members" section of the group info, search for your bot's username (the one you chose when you created the bot with BotFather, usually ending in `_bot`).
    * Select your bot from the search results and tap "Add".

{{< /details >}}


**Important Considerations for Bots in Groups:**

* **Privacy Settings:** By default, bots in groups can only see messages that directly mention them (e.g., `@YourBotName some command`). If you want your bot to be able to read all messages in the group, you need to adjust its privacy settings via BotFather.
    * Talk to BotFather in Telegram.
    * Send the command `/setprivacy`.
    * Choose your bot from the list and see which one it has.
    * If its "Disable" your bot can read all messages. Be mindful of the implications of this setting.
* **Permissions:** As the group creator or an admin, you can manage the permissions of both regular users and bots within the group (e.g., who can send messages, add members, etc.).

![TG Bots Settings](/blog_img/dev/tb-mybots.png)

For me, using `/mybots` allow me to change it.


* To obtain your **chat ID on Telegram**, you can follow these steps:
  * Open the Telegram app on your mobile device or use the Telegram web version on your computer.
  * Start a chat with the "userinfobot." You can search for it by its username: @userinfobot.
  * Once you've started a chat with @userinfobot, send any message to it.
  * The `@userinfobot` will reply with information about your chat, including your chat ID. The chat ID will be a numerical value.
  * Copy the chat ID provided by @userinfobot. This is the ID you will use in your Python code as the chat_id variable.
