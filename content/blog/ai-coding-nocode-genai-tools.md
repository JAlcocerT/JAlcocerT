#### N8N

2. What is n8n?

* https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n
* https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/
  * https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/starter-kits/ai-starter-kit/
  * https://docs.n8n.io/choose-n8n/#platforms

* **Low-Code/No-Code, but with Code Flexibility:** n8n is often described as a "low-code" platform. This means it provides a visual, drag-and-drop interface for building workflows without needing to write code for basic tasks. However, it also allows users (especially developers) to insert custom JavaScript or Python code within nodes for more complex logic and transformations.
* **Node-Based Architecture:** Workflows in n8n are built by connecting "nodes." Each node represents a specific action, trigger, or data transformation (e.g., an HTTP request, a data manipulation, sending an email, or interacting with an AI model).
* **Self-Hostable and Open-Source:** A significant advantage of n8n is that it's open-source and can be self-hosted. This gives you full control over your data, privacy, and infrastructure, which is a major differentiator from many other cloud-only automation platforms. They also offer a cloud-hosted version for convenience.
* **Extensive Integrations:** n8n boasts hundreds of pre-built integrations with popular applications, databases, and cloud services (e.g., Slack, GitHub, Google Sheets, Salesforce, HubSpot, OpenAI). If an integration doesn't exist, you can use the generic HTTP Request node or create custom nodes to connect to almost any API.
* **AI and LLM Capabilities:** n8n is well-positioned for the "AI age." It has native support for integrating with AI services like OpenAI's GPT models, Claude, and Hugging Face. This allows you to build sophisticated AI-powered workflows for tasks like summarizing content, generating replies, classifying data, and creating AI agents.
* **Use Cases:** n8n is used for a wide range of automation, including:
    * Automating repetitive tasks across various tools.
    * Building complex data pipelines (ETL).
    * Creating custom integrations between applications.
    * Marketing automation (lead capture, email campaigns).
    * CRM integration and data synchronization.
    * IT Operations (onboarding, security incident enrichment).
    * Building AI agents.
    * Customer support automation.


{{< details title="Why should you care about N8N? | Vibe Coding + JSON Driven Workflows üìå" closed="true" >}}

n8n (pronounced "n-eight-n") is a powerful and flexible workflow automation tool. Here's a breakdown of what it is and how you can work with its workflow JSON:

**Can you feed workflow JSON to n8n?**

**Absolutely, yes!** n8n workflows are essentially saved as JSON files.

This is a core feature that enables sharing, versioning, and **programmatic management of workflows**.

You can import and export workflows in several ways:

1.  **Copy-Paste in the UI:**
    * In the n8n Editor UI, you can select nodes (or the entire workflow) and copy them to your clipboard (`Ctrl+C` or `Cmd+C`).
    * You can then paste them (`Ctrl+V` or `Cmd+V`) into another n8n instance or even a text editor to see the JSON structure.
    * Conversely, you can copy workflow JSON from a file or another source and paste it directly into the n8n canvas to import it.

2.  **From the Editor UI Menu:**
    * **Download:** You can download your current workflow as a JSON file to your computer. This is great for backing up or sharing.
    * **Import from File:** You can upload a JSON file from your computer to import a workflow.
    * **Import from URL:** You can import workflow JSON directly from a URL (e.g., a GitHub Gist or a shared link).

3.  **From the Command Line (CLI):**
    * If you're self-hosting n8n (especially in Docker environments), you can use the n8n CLI to import and export workflows programmatically.
    * Commands like `n8n import:workflow --input=file.json` allow you to import workflows. This is particularly useful for DevOps practices, CI/CD pipelines, and managing workflows across different environments (development, staging, production).

**Benefits of using workflow JSON:**

* **Sharing:** Easily share workflows with others in the n8n community or within your team.
* **Version Control:** Store your workflow JSON files in Git or other version control systems, treating your automations as "code." This allows for tracking changes, reverting to previous versions, and collaborative development.
* **Vibe Coding / Building Outside n8n:** Yes, if you understand the n8n workflow JSON structure (which is fairly logical), you could technically "vibe code" or manually construct parts of a workflow in JSON and then import it. This is advanced, but certainly possible, especially for experienced developers.
* **Programmatic Deployment:** Automate the deployment of workflows to new n8n instances.
* **Community Templates:** The n8n community is active and shares many pre-built workflow templates in JSON format. You can find these on the official n8n website (under "Workflows" or "Templates") and in community forums/repositories.

{{< /details >}}

**Important Considerations when sharing/importing JSON:**

* **Credentials:** Workflow JSON files *include credential names and IDs*. While IDs aren't sensitive, the names could be. Crucially, **they generally do NOT include the actual sensitive credential data (like API keys)**. When you import a workflow, you'll need to manually re-link or create new credentials in your n8n instance for the workflow to function.
* **Webhook URLs:** If a workflow uses a Webhook trigger, the URL will be specific to the original n8n instance. When you import it, you'll likely need to generate a new Webhook URL for your instance and update any external services configured to call that webhook.
* **Node Versions:** Occasionally, if you import a workflow built with a much older or newer version of n8n, you might encounter minor compatibility issues or warnings about outdated nodes. These are usually easy to resolve by updating the nodes within the UI.

In summary, n8n is a highly capable and developer-friendly automation tool, and its reliance on JSON for workflow definition makes it incredibly flexible for sharing, managing, and integrating with your existing development workflows.

#### TG Bots

3. Telegram...bots?

They can be used via n8n: https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/

But also code driven, if you dare.

Sometime ago I was doing some tests with [tg bots](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Private/tree/main/Web_scrapping/Py_BeautifulSoup/TelegramBot), but that was all before the LLM boom.

And definitely there are interesting bots outthere, like the `bibliotecasecreta.nl`:

* https://core.telegram.org/bots/api
  * https://pypi.org/project/python-telegram-bot/
  * https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot
  * https://docs.python-telegram-bot.org/en/stable/telegram.ext.application.html

```sh
pip install python-telegram-bot==22.0
```

{{< callout type="info" >}}
It was about time to make [a project again with a telegram bot](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/EntreAgujayPunto/tree/main/TelegramBot) üíª (combined with [web](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/websites-themes-2024/)!)
{{< /callout >}}

Its all done with Python and the following **project structure**:

{{< filetree/container >}}
  {{< filetree/folder name="TelegramBot" >}}
    {{< filetree/file name=".dockerignore" >}}
    {{< filetree/file name=".env" >}}
    {{< filetree/file name=".env.sample" >}}
    {{< filetree/file name="Dockerfile" >}}
    {{< filetree/folder name="Z_Tests" state="closed" >}}
      {{< filetree/file name="tg_bot_image5.py" >}}
      {{< filetree/file name="z_tg_bot_botchatero.py" >}}
    {{< /filetree/folder >}}
    {{< filetree/file name="docker-compose.yml" >}}
    {{< filetree/file name="readme.md" >}}
    {{< filetree/file name="requirements.txt" >}}
    {{< filetree/file name="tg_bot_agujapunto.py" >}}
    {{< filetree/folder name="tgbot_image_venv" state="closed" >}}
      {{< filetree/file name="lib/python3.10/site-packages/..." >}}
    {{< /filetree/folder >}}
    {{< filetree/folder name="tgbot_venv" state="closed" >}}
      {{< filetree/file name="lib/python3.10/site-packages/..." >}}
    {{< /filetree/folder >}}
  {{< /filetree/folder >}}
{{< /filetree/container >}}

With a `.env` file like this one:

```
BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
CHAT_ID=YOUR_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID_HERE
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE
```

{{< details title="Setup a TG Bot | BotFather and API Tokens üìå" closed="true" >}}

* Open the **Telegram** app and search for the "BotFather" user.
* Start a chat with BotFather and use the `/newbot` command to create a new bot.
* Name your bot: *botwithuniquename*
* The bot will be `botwithuniquename_bot` -> <https://t.me/botwithuniquename_bot>
* Follow the instructions to set a name and username for your bot.
* Once the bot is created, BotFather will provide you with an **API token**.
  *  Save this token; you'll need it in your Python code.

with **/token** you can change the token:

{{< /details >}}

With the API token, you can use this token to access the HTTP API for your new bot.

![Bot Father](/blog_img/dev/tg-botfather.png)

{{< details title="Telegram Bots in groups üìå" closed="true" >}}

You can definitely create a group in Telegram and add both regular users and bots to it.**

Here's how you would typically do it:

1.  **Create a New Group:**
    * Open your Telegram app.
    * Tap the "New Message" icon (usually a pencil in a circle).
    * Select "New Group".

2.  **Add the First Regular User:**
    * Telegram will ask you to select the first member for your group. Choose one of the regular users you want to include.
    * Tap "Next" (or a similar button).

3.  **Name Your Group:**
    * Give your group a name.
    * You can also set a group photo if you like.
    * Tap "Create" (or a similar button).

4.  **Add the Second Regular User:**
    * Once the group is created, open the group chat.
    * Tap on the group name at the top to view the group info.
    * Look for an option like "Add members" or a "+" icon.
    * Select the second regular user you want to add and tap "Add".

5.  **Add Your Bot:**
    * In the same "Add members" section of the group info, search for your bot's username (the one you chose when you created the bot with BotFather, usually ending in `_bot`).
    * Select your bot from the search results and tap "Add".

{{< /details >}}


**Important Considerations for Bots in Groups:**

* **Privacy Settings:** By default, bots in groups can only see messages that directly mention them (e.g., `@YourBotName some command`). If you want your bot to be able to read all messages in the group, you need to adjust its privacy settings via BotFather.
    * Talk to BotFather in Telegram.
    * Send the command `/setprivacy`.
    * Choose your bot from the list and see which one it has.
    * If its "Disable" your bot can read all messages. Be mindful of the implications of this setting.
* **Permissions:** As the group creator or an admin, you can manage the permissions of both regular users and bots within the group (e.g., who can send messages, add members, etc.).

![TG Bots Settings](/blog_img/dev/tb-mybots.png)

For me, using `/mybots` allow me to change it.


* To obtain your **chat ID on Telegram**, you can follow these steps:
  * Open the Telegram app on your mobile device or use the Telegram web version on your computer.
  * Start a chat with the "userinfobot." You can search for it by its username: @userinfobot.
  * Once you've started a chat with @userinfobot, send any message to it.
  * The `@userinfobot` will reply with information about your chat, including your chat ID. The chat ID will be a numerical value.
  * Copy the chat ID provided by @userinfobot. This is the ID you will use in your Python code as the chat_id variable.



{{< details title="Telegram Bots with LLMs üìå" closed="true" >}}

Instead of giving hardcoded replies, you can plug any LLM to process and reply the conversation

You could also manage to do Telegram Bots to download given images and then interprete it via a multi-modal model.
