**TL;DR**

More than web analytics, see what the users are experiencing.

Some [Product Tools](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/product-tools/) that we can selfhost.

**Intro**

If you got your SaaS reachable by potential users.

Or you are a PdM or a [DA with product vision](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/product-skills-for-data-analytics/)...

You will want to know what it works and what not.

But for real.

What are the users experiencing.

## OpenReplay

* https://www.openreplay.com/

{{< details title="Adding OpenReplay to a Astro Site ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

Go to https://app.openreplay.com/login


```sh
npm i @openreplay/tracker
```

Copy the json before the `</head>`, normally in `BaseLayout.astro`

```json

```

{{< /details >}}

## PostHog

* https://eu.posthog.com/project/15002/replay/home

Then, you will need to add this kind of snippet before the `/head`:

```html
    <script>
    //somethingsomething 
      posthog.init('phc_someid', {
          api_host: 'https://eu.i.posthog.com',
          person_profiles: 'identified_only', // or 'always' to create profiles for anonymous users as well
      })
  </script>
```

Matomo - it has session recording in the on premise option, but is to be paid for that plugin
