Go to https://app.openreplay.com/login


```sh
npm i @openreplay/tracker
```

Copy the json before the `</head>`, normally in `BaseLayout.astro`

```

## PostHog

* https://eu.posthog.com/project/15002/replay/home

Then, you will need to add this kind of snippet before the `/head`:

```html
    <script>
    //somethingsomething 
      posthog.init('phc_someid', {
          api_host: 'https://eu.i.posthog.com',
          person_profiles: 'identified_only', // or 'always' to create profiles for anonymous users as well
      })
  </script>
```
