**Tl;DR**

Artists, artists...

Thats what social media has made us believe we are

All while we place the head of a pig in the public, while we actually sell dogs.

**Intro**

If you are not a data professional, but a creative professional, like a music creator...

You will need to let the world know about your work/brand and where to find it.

That might be the thought of someone still trying to sell to the B2C world.

> As of today, im not sure if selling to 9-5 *,grey'* people is the best niche though

I made couple of posts about ssg **themes for links**:

## Conclusions


Examples of Portfolio Links websites?

* https://peladonerd.com/
* https://jalcocert.github.io/Portfolio

More competitors on the **Saas Link Website domain**:
  * Taplink
  * bento.me *A comercial bento link website, owned by linktree*
  * https://getallmylinks.com/
  * https://subscribepage.io/listy#

  


You wont probably need [session recording](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/how-to-record-web-sessions/) for such sites.

But after the mandatory **web validation**:


```sh
#sudo apt-get install dnsutils -y #dns resolution
nslookup github.com 
dig google.com

curl -s -o /dev/null -w "dns_lookup: %{time_namelookup}s connect: %{time_connect}s appconnect: %{time_appconnect}s pretransfer: %{time_pretransfer}s starttransfer: %{time_starttransfer}s ---------- total: %{time_total}s http_code: %{http_code}" https://blog.jalcocertech.com
```

You will want to know how it performs:



### SaaS around Links

* More competitors
  * Taplink
  * bento.me
  * https://getallmylinks.com/
  * https://subscribepage.io/listy#
  * https://linke.ro/
  <!-- * Proposed: bogusiabachata.pro -->



#### What we say vs what we do

* **Stated Preference (What they say):** Based on hypothetical questions. It captures what users *claim* they would choose.
* **Revealed Preference (What they do):** Based on actual behavior. It captures true preferences through real-world actions and choices.

La preferencia anunciada o preferencia declarada es un método para conocer las preferencias de los usuarios basado en lo que ellos dicen que elegirían en situaciones hipotéticas o que no han experimentado en la realidad. Es muy utilizada en economía para anticipar cómo los consumidores podrían reaccionar ante nuevas opciones que aún no existen en el mercado. Por ejemplo, se puede preguntar a una persona qué opciones preferiría en un producto nuevo o servicio que no ha probado.[1]

Por otro lado, la preferencia revelada se basa en observar el comportamiento real de consumo del usuario, es decir, en las decisiones y elecciones efectivas que hace en la vida cotidiana. La teoría de la preferencia revelada sostiene que las preferencias de los consumidores se pueden deducir de sus hábitos de compra reales, ya que el hecho de elegir un bien sobre otro revela cuál prefieren realmente bajo las restricciones de su presupuesto. Esto implica que las preferencias se infieren a partir de las elecciones efectivas, no de declaraciones hipotéticas.[2]




| Type | Definition | PostHog Tool to Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stated** | "I would use this feature." | **Surveys & Feedback:** Ask users directly what they want before building. |
| **Revealed** | They actually clicked/paid. | **Analytics & Session Replay:** Track clicks, retention, and time spent to see if they actually use it. |
| **The Goal** | **The Say/Do Gap** | Compare survey results against analytics to see if users are actually doing what they promised. |


### Vibe Coding is...old?

People seem to be moving from vibe coding to...sth new: spec driven development they call it.

And these are some tools:

* https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec

> MIT | Spec-driven development for AI coding assistants.

* https://github.com/github/spec-kit

> MIT | 💫 Toolkit to help you get started with Spec-Driven Development

* https://github.com/kirodotdev/Kiro

> Kiro is an agentic IDE that works alongside you from prototype to production.

#### About Web Development

Not sure how much better spec driven dev is.

But for sure that as of today you dont need to now [TS](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/whats-typescript/), neither [JavaScript](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/javascript-for-static-websites/) nor [CSS](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/blog/dev-web-code-css/) to create and publish a good looking and simple static website.

I recently tried [NuxtJS here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/trying-nuxt-themes/).

## FAQ

### SelfHostable Links

1. Lynx. But not the Lynx HUGO Theme.

* https://github.com/paoloronco/Lynx

> MIT |  Lynx is an open-source, self-hosted link manager that helps you gather all your digital touchpoints in a single page, with secure authentication and a fully customizable design. 

2. LinkStack. As seen [here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/linktree-web-alternative/#selfhosted-solutions-for-linkinbio) and [here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/portfolio-website-for-social-media/)

### SelfHosted WebAnalytics

Every time I read the selfh.st newsletter I find a new web analytics tool trying to replace Umami:

* https://github.com/seuros/kaunta

> Privacy-focused analytics engine written in Go

* https://github.com/electerious/Ackee 

But imo, Umami should be one of those **HomeLab essentials** tools to consider.

For the **QR part**, you know that we have few solutions...

1. https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Streamlit_PoC/blob/main/Utils/QR_Gen.py

2. [![Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JAlcocerT/JAlcocerT/blob/main/Z_TestingLanguages/Z_Python/QR_generation.ipynb)


There are several open-source self-hostable link shortener tools you can consider, each with its unique features:

1. **Shlink**: A PHP-based link shortener that supports generating unique short codes or custom slugs. It collects anonymized visit stats and geolocates visitors. It offers a REST API, CLI tools, and Docker support for easy deployment. It uses modern technologies like Mezzio and Symfony and is MIT licensed.[1][3]

2. **Kutt**: A modern, free, and open-source URL shortener with features like custom domains, custom URLs, password protection, link expiration, private statistics, and an admin dashboard. It has a RESTful API and can be easily installed using Docker Compose.[5]

3. **YOURLS**: A well-established PHP-based URL shortener with features such as bookmarklets, developer API, detailed stats including referrers and geo-location, and extensibility through dozens of plugins. It is free, open source, and easy to self-host.[10]

4. **Shrink.io (shrtn.io)**: A lightweight, privacy-focused URL shortener using SQLite by default (so no database server is required) and deployable via Docker. It emphasizes ease of use, privacy, and developer-friendly features.[6]

5. Other notable mentions from a curated list include Polr, Lstu, Blink, and goshorly—all open source with various programming languages and features.[4][8]

These options provide scalable, customizable, and self-hostable link shortening solutions that you can deploy either via Docker or direct installation depending on your infrastructure and preferences.

For ease and feature richness, Shlink, Kutt, and YOURLS are highly recommended starting points for a self-hosted URL shortener.

Among the popular open-source self-hosted link shorteners mentioned, some do offer QR code capabilities either built-in or through extensions/plugins:

1. **Shlink**: Provides built-in QR code generation for short URLs. When you create a short URL using Shlink, it can generate a corresponding QR code that you can share or embed. This is part of its feature set, making it convenient for print or mobile scanning use cases.[1][2]

2. **Kutt**: While Kutt does not include native QR code generation in its core, there are third-party tools or browser extensions available that can generate QR codes for any URL, including Kutt short links. Some community forks or plugins might add this feature. Officially, out-of-the-box QR codes are not a core feature.[3]

3. **YOURLS**: YOURLS does not include native QR code generation by default, but there are several plugins created by the community that add QR code functionality to YOURLS short URLs. This extensibility allows you to add QR generation if needed.[4]

4. Other lesser-known tools like Blink or Polr may have QR features built-in or via plugins, but the top three mentioned mostly rely on either built-in Shlink support or plugins for YOURLS for QR capabilities.[5][6]

To summarize, **Shlink** stands out as the self-hosted URL shortener with built-in QR code generation. 

For YOURLS, you can enable QR codes through community-developed plugins, while Kutt typically requires external QR code tools. 

This makes Shlink a strong candidate if QR code functionality is a priority alongside link shortening.
