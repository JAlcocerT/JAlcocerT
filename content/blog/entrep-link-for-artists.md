**Tl;DR**

Artists, artists...

Thats what social media has made us believe we are

All while we place the head of a pig in the public, while we actually sell dogs.



<!--

**Intro**

If you are not a data professional, but a creative professional, like a music creator...

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/music-with-ai-tools/" title="Creating Music with AI Post" image="/blog_img/GenAI/elevenlabs/11labs-download-tts.png" subtitle="DIY music? or with 11labs we can create music" >}}
{{< /cards >}}


You will need to let the world know about your work/brand and where to find it.

That might be the thought of someone still trying to sell to the B2C world.

> As of today, im not sure if selling to 9-5 *,grey'* people is the best niche though

### SaaS around Links

People are building SaaS around links:

* Taplink
* bento.me
* https://getallmylinks.com/
* https://subscribepage.io/listy#
* https://linke.ro/
<!-- * Proposed: bogusiabachata.pro -->

* https://linktr.ee/lynnic
* https://www.youtube.com/@lynnic/featured


* https://indiepa.ge/charlieclark
* https://github.com/charlieclark
* https://www.liinks.co/?ref=indiepage_leaderboard

Which is validated to have done 1M+ https://indiepa.ge/leaderboard as of the time of writing

#### OSS Links Web Profiles

I made couple of posts about ssg **themes for links**:

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/cool-link-in-bios/" title="LinkinBio with Astro" image="/blog_img/web/WebsSnapshots/financeinmotion-astrolinks.png" subtitle="Links with astro-link-in-bio-theme - FinanceInMotion FYI" >}}
  {{< card link="https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/portfolio-website-for-social-media/" title="Links with HUGO LYNX Theme" image="/blog_img/web/WebsSnapshots/Web_PortfolioLinks.png" subtitle="Collection of important Links on Github Pages" >}}             
{{< /cards >}}

A Theme that [brings TinyCMS support and that i tried](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/gabemorris12-mechanism-project-setup/#tinacms) is: https://github.com/DBozhinovski/astro-theme-ltree

> An Astro theme that replicates Linktree _and_ Linkinbio rolled in one. Optional TinaCMS on top.

And recently I found about:

* https://github.com/francosuarez-dev/artistree
  * Which I could not avoid to fork: https://github.com/JAlcocerT/artistree

```md
#and added my fav tool of the year
Add a Makefile with bare metal install, dev and container-dev with also help
```

![Artistree Theme UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JAlcocerT/artistree/main/public/new-preview.png)

> **MIT** | Link in Bio Page for Artists 🎶

```sh
git clone https://github.com/JAlcocerT/artistree
cd artistree
make help
#make install & make dev
#make container-dev
```

Which can be an interesting compaion for LittleLink, which allow to builds links websites wo/code:

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/artistree" title="FORKED - Artistree Theme" image="/blog_img/apps/gh-jalcocert.svg" subtitle="Astro Kindof LinkTree for Artists" >}}
  {{< card link="https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/linktree-web-alternative/#selfhosted-solutions-for-linkinbio" title="LinkStack and LittleLink" image="/blog_img/web/web-linkstack.png" subtitle="Two Selfhosted Link Alternatives" >}}
{{< /cards >}}


### What Links to show?

Because...

You have something more to show that social media apps...right?

Here you have some ideas with projects that I have been publishing about before.

Also, you can plug [Web Analytics](#web-analytics) or [Link Analytics](#link-analytics) to your links.

#### Waiting List for Products

I first built a Waiting2Landing: Two Astro Themes working together

First the waiting list theme captures leads via formbricks, then, changing to an agency landing page:

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/how-to-create-a-waiting-list/" title="Astros WaitingToLanding" image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JAlcocerT/waiting-to-landing/main/screens/demoLight.webp" subtitle="POST of Waiting2Landing with 2 Astro Themes" >}}
  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/waiting-to-landing" title="Waiting to Landing Repo" image="/blog_img/apps/gh-jalcocert.svg" subtitle="Two Astro Themes + Formbricks to capture emails" >}}
{{< /cards >}}


That should allow you to build DIY websites for your brand, as [I have been doing](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/gatsby-ghost-integration/#other-websites-ive-built)

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/waiting-list-pocketbase/" title="The Waiting2Landing v2 PB Post" image="/blog_img/web/waitingtolanding/link-hub.png" subtitle="I tinkered here more with CSR and linkhub than actually building the waiting2landing v2 with PB instead of formbricks as per v1" >}}
  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/simple-waiting-list" title="Simple Waiting List Repo" image="/blog_img/apps/gh-jalcocert.svg" subtitle="NextJS + CapJS = Working Waiting list to CSV with no external APIs" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

I created this in the middle of the [last real estate updates post](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/real-estate-landing/#the-stack):

![CapJS + NextJS Working as a Simple Waiting List](/blog_img/dev/nextjs/capjs-nextjs-pow.png)

It's a clear example that, if you know what you are doing (at least vibe coding with the right fwk & instructions), you can get a: Cool UI/UX for Web, Admin Panel, with no external APIs, and a working waiting list to CSV for you to process later on.

#### Landing Page for your SaaS

After the waiting list and checking PMF, comes building time.

For which you should have [a cool Landing Page](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/selling-with-a-landing-website/).

It does not have to be the Lando Norris Page, neither the genkinfy.

But the aster you go from Idea to WaitingList/Landing *depending on your popularity* and to deployment into VPS, the higher changes to get Stripe notifications.

> It detects the framework, the web analytics, the ads...

A landing as companion for a link website does not have to be a multi-page one though:

![DataNova Theme](/blog_img/web/astro/astro-datanova-animated-graph.png)

> I migrated my brand to that data centered landing (and more) theme on [this post](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/keystaticcms-astrodb/)

##### Vibe Coded Landing Pages

This time, I wanted something quick with **NextJS**, and to try[ from the UI/X side **shadcn/ui**](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/blog/dev-web-code-css/#conclusions) and from the backend the **authJS** instead of the [last MUI + better auth x server](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/make-podcast/#auth-via-server-auth).


{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/docs/dev/authentication/" title="Authentication | Docs ↗" icon="book-open" >}}
  {{< card link="https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/docs/dev/fe-vs-be/" title="Fe vs Be | Docs ↗" icon="book-open" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

So taking the last learnings from [here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/make-podcast/#creating-a-podcast-platform), I prepared:


{{< details title="Vibe Coding a Modern Landing Page x Shadcn x AuthJS | Setup  📌" closed="true" >}}

Go to whatever LLM you are using and ask: `do you think that these requirements are clear enough?`

```md
Create a Landing Page based on NextJS with a cool and modern UI

There will be a login button that directs to `/login` from which via better-auth and a sqlite with a unique username and password provided as per .env that is the one who can access the `/admin`

Include a `dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` that will control the title, description, open-graph image, favicon location and other global website variables via environment variables.

Create also a makefile with the following commands:

* `make help` - Show available commands
* `make install` - Prepare the dependencies for local development
* `make dev` - Run development server
* `make container` - Build and Run in Docker container
```

> This time I was more specific than others on the [UI, with **MUI** ](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/blog/dev-web-code-css/#material-ui---mui)

> > Also, [MIU has now its llm.txt](https://mui.com/material-ui/llms.txt)

Then go to [AntiGravity IDE](#antigravity-ide) and ask if the `brd.md` refined already with Gemini is clear enough.

If it is clear define the `z-development-plan.md` and proceed with the development phases.

```sh
# git init
# git branch -m main
# git config user.name
# git config --global user.name "JAlcocerT"
# git config --global user.name
# git add .
# git commit -m "Initial commit: Starting simple make podcast platform"

#sudo apt install gh
gh auth login
#gh repo create make-podcast --private --source=. --remote=origin --push
    
git init && git add . && git commit -m "Initial commit: simple landing website" && gh repo create make-landing --private --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

{{< /details >}}

Vibe coded it today, placed into [this previous post](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/micro-saas/) during my too optimistic period of 1 post a day earlier this year.

{{< /cards >}}


For sth very quick and simple VanillaJS is enough, but if you really want to put a service behind, like users editing their own content etc...


https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/selling-with-a-landing-website/


```sh
git clone https://github.com/JAlcocerT/make-landing
cd make-landing
make help
#make install && make dev
```

> This is how easy is to go today beyond WP and Elementor!

> > And is not a bad niche at all, as I havent seen any Selfhostable SaaS for this kind of service with hosted version for money


##### Status Pages

If you have few SaaS within your offer: you will want to prove the uptime status of your services

{{< cards cols="2" >}}
  {{< card link="https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/docs/selfhosting/monitoring/" title="Monitoring | Docs ↗" >}}
{{< /cards >}}



#### eBooks Pages

[Some People](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/ai-driven-ebooks/#how-people-send-ebooks) sell information via ebooks, why dont you do that?

In case you didnt know, creating [an ebook as a code](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/things-as-a-code/#ebooks-as-a-code) is not that hard:

![Astro landing page book - Sell your ebook UI](/blog_img/shipping/astro-sell-your-ebook.png)

{{< youtube "XEFpzEIEDFc" >}}


<!-- https://github.com/JAlcocerT/sell-your-ebook -->


<!-- For now, this is a page with 1 ebook:

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="https://diy.jalcocertech.com/" title="DIY Website eBook" image="/blog_img/dev/fastapi/ebook-obfuscate-ui.png" subtitle="JAlcocerTech DIY Series | Ebook to create a Website for your brand" >}}
{{< /cards >}} -->

If you tinker with obfuscation, you can also publish a web/ook and allow to download the PDF as per certain conditions:

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/sell-your-ebook" title="Sell your eBook Repo" image="/blog_img/apps/gh-jalcocert.svg" subtitle="Source Code. Astro SSG ebook Theme (x) Stripe (x) N8N" >}}

{{< /cards >}}

Additionally to the base theme: https://github.com/candidosales/landing-page-book-astro-tailwind

That I was tinkering with on [this post](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/cool-ebooks/)

There are other cool ones like:

* https://github.com/understanding-astro/understanding-astro-book

> The book content about astro is free available, but no license and no way to download the full pdf out of the box

You need to provide your contact details to get it for free :)

![Astro book Theme UI](/blog_img/shipping/astro-ebook-subscribe.png)

#### Obfuscated web/book pages

It all started [here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/ai-driven-ebooks/#show-and-obfuscate) while testing how to create AI driven ebooks on [this repo: initially with RMD](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/ebooks).

#### Calendars

Something that looks really professional is to provide your availability.

As you are a cool creator, you will have a lot of demand:

#### Photo Galleries

Last time I wrote about Photo Galleries was [here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/mailerlite-for-saas/#photo-gallery).

I dont need to tell you why you need a photo centered link to your own photo gallery: *Im just here to tell you that you can*

* https://github.com/iamnyasha/minimma - Check this one if you are modelling :)

> MIT | Interesting and simple Photo Centered Astro Theme

But Ive been playing around quite a lot to get proper ig like galleries for real estate and for bloggers to have a cool place to publish.

<!--

I have added few shortcodes/components: *like [whatsap bouble](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/just-ssg/tree/main/astro-ssg/whatsapp-bouble)*

Also, thanks to have tinkered with Nuxt (Vue) recently, got to know a very cool one: https://github.com/antfu/vue-starport

https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/open-source-photo-gallery/

https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/hugo-pocketbase-and-r2/

![CF R2 Pricing](/blog_img/web/agujapunto-r2-firebase/r2-101.png)


#### Podcasts

By this time, you have a lot of audience: *you are an artist!*

So having one of the links pointing to your podcast platform is very simple.

<!-- ![Astro Podcast Theme UI](/blog_img/shipping/astro-podcast.png) -->

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/make-podcast/" title="Tech for Podcasts" image="/blog_img/shipping/astro-podcast-2.png" subtitle="Creating a serverless Astro Podcast that can be selfhosted with containers" >}}

#### Tech Talks

If you have a podcast, chances are that you are **doing public speaking** out there.


{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/docs/coolresources/diagrams_ppts/" title="PPTs | Docs ↗" icon="book-open" >}}
  {{< card link="https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/about-inflation/#a-cv-via-yamlresume-vs-overleaf" title="CVs as a Code via YAML | Post ↗" >}}
{{< /cards >}}


##### PPT References

Who could have guess that you can do cool ppts as code:

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/ai-driven-presentations/" title="Sample Tech Talk" image="/blog_img/DA/ppt/slidev-editor-viewer.png" subtitle="Using SliDev to create PPTs" >}}
  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/slidev-editor" title="SliDev Editor Repo" image="/blog_img/DA/ppt/slidev-editor.png" subtitle="NextJS ToastUI and SliDev ppts, with historical tech talks..." >}}
{{< /cards >}}

And have them referenced into a repo to keep the history

While sharing the ppt as one of the links :)

##### Last Video Uploaded

Chances are also that you are recording the sessions and uploading them to youtube.

Get the last youtube video of your channel like: *just take the ChannelID*

{{< cards cols="1" >}}
  {{< card link="https://youtube.com/@JAlcocerTech" title="My YT Tech Channel ↗" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

1. Go to youtube studio and you will get the YT channelID
2. Then, use it into your link kindofwebsite via

<!-- 
https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UCPPMA8ZEusAe5dVH6PbjZFA/videos/ -->

```sh
curl -s "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCPPMA8ZEusAe5dVH6PbjZFA"
#curl -s "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCPPMA8ZEusAe5dVH6PbjZFA" | grep -oP '(?<=<title>).*?(?=</title>)' | head -5
```

##### Your CV

Oh I wrote tech talks instead of just motivational speaches: *because you are an artist.*

In case you are not, you could also plug as one of the links **your updated CV**:

{{< cards cols="1" >}}
  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Home-Lab/tree/main/yamlresume" title="YAML Resume | Docker Config 🐋 ↗" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

If you have been having a long experience, you should [keep track of that](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/cv-laitex/tree/main/MyExperience)


> Just remember that one thing are beautiful CVs and other [machine readable cvs](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/cv-laitex/tree/main/CV_Parsing)

If you are looking to impress with a new curriculum, why not doing it as a **web CV**?

## Conclusions

Examples of Portfolio Links websites?

* https://peladonerd.com/
* https://jalcocert.github.io/Portfolio - Deployed statically via GH Pages completely free!

More competitors on the **Saas Link Website domain**:

  * Taplink
  * bento.me *A comercial bento link website, owned by linktree*
  * https://getallmylinks.com/
  * https://subscribepage.io/listy#

  
I have been kind of trapped within SSGs to create cool websites as per a vibe coded version of what other real web devs have put together first.

But for simple link/bento/landing pages...just goahead and vibe code it from scratch via NextJS 'with a modern UI'.

Then, you wont probably need [session recording](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/how-to-record-web-sessions/) for such sites.

But you will want to validate the **web performance**:

```sh
#sudo apt-get install dnsutils -y #dns resolution
nslookup github.com 
dig google.com

curl -s -o /dev/null -w "dns_lookup: %{time_namelookup}s connect: %{time_connect}s appconnect: %{time_appconnect}s pretransfer: %{time_pretransfer}s starttransfer: %{time_starttransfer}s ---------- total: %{time_total}s http_code: %{http_code}" https://blog.jalcocertech.com

### Vibe Coding is...old?

People seem to be moving from vibe coding to...sth new: spec driven development they call it.

![Spec Driven Development - Meme](/blog_img/GenAI/spec-driven.png)

And these are some tools:

> MIT | Spec-driven development for AI coding assistants.

* https://github.com/github/spec-kit

> MIT | 💫 Toolkit to help you get started with Spec-Driven Development

* https://github.com/kirodotdev/Kiro

> Kiro is an agentic IDE that works alongside you from prototype to production.

#### About Web Development

Not sure how much better spec driven dev is.

But for sure that as of today you dont need to now [TS](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/whats-typescript/), neither [JavaScript](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/javascript-for-static-websites/) nor [CSS](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/blog/dev-web-code-css/) to create and publish a good looking and simple static website.

I recently tried [NuxtJS here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/trying-nuxt-themes/).

And its quite clear that you better go with most popular fwks to build your own.

## FAQ

### What we say vs what we do

* **Stated Preference (What they say):** Based on hypothetical questions. It captures what users *claim* they would choose.
* **Revealed Preference (What they do):** Based on actual behavior. It captures true preferences through real-world actions and choices.

La preferencia anunciada o preferencia declarada es un método para conocer las preferencias de los usuarios basado en lo que ellos dicen que elegirían en situaciones hipotéticas o que no han experimentado en la realidad.

Es muy utilizada en economía para anticipar cómo los consumidores podrían reaccionar ante nuevas opciones que aún no existen en el mercado. Por ejemplo, se puede preguntar a una persona qué opciones preferiría en un producto nuevo o servicio que no ha probado.[1]

Por otro lado, la preferencia revelada se basa en observar el comportamiento real de consumo del usuario, es decir, en las decisiones y elecciones efectivas que hace en la vida cotidiana.

La teoría de la preferencia revelada sostiene que las preferencias de los consumidores se pueden deducir de sus hábitos de compra reales, ya que el hecho de elegir un bien sobre otro revela cuál prefieren realmente bajo las restricciones de su presupuesto.

Esto implica que las preferencias se infieren a partir de las elecciones efectivas, no de declaraciones hipotéticas.[2]

| Type | Definition | PostHog Tool to Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stated** | "I would use this feature." | **Surveys & Feedback:** Ask users directly what they want before building. |
| **Revealed** | They actually clicked/paid. | **Analytics & Session Replay:** Track clicks, retention, and time spent to see if they actually use it. |
| **The Goal** | **The Say/Do Gap** | Compare survey results against analytics to see if users are actually doing what they promised. |


### SelfHostable Links

1. Lynx. But not the Lynx HUGO Theme.

* https://github.com/paoloronco/Lynx

> MIT |  Lynx is an open-source, self-hosted link manager that helps you gather all your digital touchpoints in a single page, with secure authentication and a fully customizable design. 

2. LinkStack. As seen [here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/linktree-web-alternative/#selfhosted-solutions-for-linkinbio) and [here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/portfolio-website-for-social-media/)

### SelfHosted WebAnalytics

If the cloudflare web analytics is not enough for you:

![CF Web Analytics](/blog_img/web/filebrowser-hugo/cloudflare-hugo-analytics.png)

Every time I read the `selfh.st `newsletter I find a new web analytics tool trying to replace Umami.

* https://github.com/seuros/kaunta

> Privacy-focused analytics engine written in Go

* https://github.com/electerious/Ackee 

**But imo, Umami** should be one of those **HomeLab essentials** tools to consider.

#### Link Analytics

Some [selfhosted url shorteners](https://fossengineer.com/selfhosted-open-source-url-shorteners/) will bring you analytics and QR as well.

See https://github.com/738/awesome-url-shortener?tab=readme-ov-file#self-hosting-opensource

Link analytics solutions, like Kutt: `https://kutt.it/`

For the **QR part**, you know that we have few solutions...

1. https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Streamlit_PoC/blob/main/Utils/QR_Gen.py

2. [![Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JAlcocerT/JAlcocerT/blob/main/Z_TestingLanguages/Z_Python/QR_generation.ipynb)


There are several open-source self-hostable link shortener tools you can consider, each with its unique features:

1. **Shlink**: A PHP-based link shortener that supports generating unique short codes or custom slugs. It collects anonymized visit stats and geolocates visitors. It offers a REST API, CLI tools, and Docker support for easy deployment. It uses modern technologies like Mezzio and Symfony and is MIT licensed.[1][3]

2. **Kutt**: A modern, free, and open-source URL shortener with features like custom domains, custom URLs, password protection, link expiration, private statistics, and an admin dashboard. It has a RESTful API and can be easily installed using Docker Compose.[5]

3. **YOURLS**: A well-established PHP-based URL shortener with features such as bookmarklets, developer API, detailed stats including referrers and geo-location, and extensibility through dozens of plugins. It is free, open source, and easy to self-host.[10]

4. **Shrink.io (shrtn.io)**: A lightweight, privacy-focused URL shortener using SQLite by default (so no database server is required) and deployable via Docker. It emphasizes ease of use, privacy, and developer-friendly features.[6]

5. Other notable mentions from a curated list include Polr, Lstu, Blink, and goshorly—all open source with various programming languages and features.[4][8]

For ease and feature richness, Shlink, Kutt, and YOURLS are highly recommended starting points for a self-hosted URL shortener.

Among the popular open-source self-hosted link shorteners mentioned, some do offer QR code capabilities either built-in or through extensions/plugins:

1. **Shlink**: Provides built-in QR code generation for short URLs. When you create a short URL using Shlink, it can generate a corresponding QR code that you can share or embed. This is part of its feature set, making it convenient for print or mobile scanning use cases.[1][2]

2. **Kutt**: While Kutt does not include native QR code generation in its core, there are third-party tools or browser extensions available that can generate QR codes for any URL, including Kutt short links. Some community forks or plugins might add this feature. Officially, out-of-the-box QR codes are not a core feature.[3]

3. **YOURLS**: YOURLS does not include native QR code generation by default, but there are several plugins created by the community that add QR code functionality to YOURLS short URLs. This extensibility allows you to add QR generation if needed.[4]

4. Other lesser-known tools like Blink or Polr may have QR features built-in or via plugins, but the top three mentioned mostly rely on either built-in Shlink support or plugins for YOURLS for QR capabilities.[5][6]

To summarize, **Shlink** stands out as the self-hosted URL shortener with built-in QR code generation. 

For YOURLS, you can enable QR codes through community-developed plugins, while Kutt typically requires external QR code tools. 

This makes Shlink a strong candidate if QR code functionality is a priority alongside link shortening.
