### Vibe Coding is...old?

People seem to be moving from vibe coding to...sth new: spec driven development they call it.

And these are some tools:

* https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec

> MIT | Spec-driven development for AI coding assistants.

* https://github.com/github/spec-kit

> MIT | 💫 Toolkit to help you get started with Spec-Driven Development

## FAQ

### SelfHostable Links

1. Lynx. But not the Lynx HUGO Theme.

* https://github.com/paoloronco/Lynx

> MIT |  Lynx is an open-source, self-hosted link manager that helps you gather all your digital touchpoints in a single page, with secure authentication and a fully customizable design. 

2. LinkStack. As seen [here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/linktree-web-alternative/#selfhosted-solutions-for-linkinbio) and [here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/portfolio-website-for-social-media/)
