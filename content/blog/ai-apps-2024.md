The goal of **this post** is:

1. To review some of the [AI projects](#ai-apps) that are helpful on my workflow
2. To learn how to use [Caddy](#how-to-setup-caddy) as [NGINX](#how-to-install-nginx)/[Traefik](#how-to-install-traefik) alternative to get HTTPs certificates

## AI Apps

1. YT Summarizer
* https://github.com/JAlcocerT/phidata
* https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/summarize-yt-videos/
* Get your Groq API for the app <https://console.groq.com/keys>

2. Streamlit MultiChat
* https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Streamlit-MultiChat
* https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/create-streamlit-chatgpt
* Get (at least) OpenAI API for this app - <https://platform.openai.com/api-keys>

![Streamlit MultiChat](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Streamlit-MultiChat/raw/main/streamlit-multichat.png)

{{< callout type="info" >}}
People out there is doing way cooler projects, like [LibreChat](https://fossengineer.com/free-open-source-llm-tools/)
{{< /callout >}}

And you will just need to:

1. Get docker/podman installed
2. Get the API's
3. [Optional] Install Portainer

## Conclusion


| Feature | Traefik | Nginx | Caddy |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Ease of Use** | High | Medium | High |
| **Performance** | Medium | High | Medium |
| **Flexibility** | High | High | Medium |
| **Dynamic Configuration** | Excellent | Requires more manual configuration | Supports some dynamic configuration |
| **HTTPS Support** | Good | Requires manual configuration | Excellent |
| **Learning Curve** | Medium | High | Low |

* **Choose Traefik if:** You prioritize automatic service discovery and a wide range of plugins.
* **Choose Nginx if:** You need maximum performance and flexibility, even if it means a steeper learning curve.
* **Choose Caddy if:** You value simplicity and ease of use, especially for HTTPS setup.


[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=lucaslorentz/caddy-docker-proxy,NginxProxyManager/nginx-proxy-manager,traefik/traefik&,type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#lucaslorentz/caddy-docker-proxy&NginxProxyManager/nginx-proxy-manager&traefik/traefik&Date)


* **Caddy Strengths:**
    * **Simplicity:** Known for its user-friendly configuration syntax, making it easier to learn and use compared to Nginx.
    * **Automatic HTTPS:** Supports automatic HTTPS certificate acquisition and management, simplifying security setup.
    * **Plugins:** Offers a growing ecosystem of plugins for various functionalities.
* **Weaknesses:**
    * **Performance:** While generally performant, it may not match Nginx's raw performance in very high-traffic scenarios.
    * **Maturity:** While gaining popularity, it's not as mature or widely used as Nginx.

I have tried Caddy with a OVH VPS Server with 2GB RAM.

Similar to the one in which I tried to deploy Wireguard (~300/1.88GB)

```sh
ssh ubuntu@57.128.public.ip
```

{{< /cards >}}

* https://github.com/NginxProxyManager/nginx-proxy-manager
* https://fossengineer.com/selfhosting-nginx-proxy-manager-docker/


* **Strengths:**
    * **High Performance:** Known for its exceptional performance and scalability, making it suitable for high-traffic environments.
    * **Flexibility:** Highly configurable and customizable, allowing for fine-grained control over traffic routing and other aspects.
    * **Mature and Widely Used:** A well-established and widely used reverse proxy with extensive community support and documentation.
* **Weaknesses:**
    * **Steeper Learning Curve:** Configuration can be more complex and require more technical expertise compared to Traefik or Caddy.
    * **Less Automatic:** Requires more manual configuration compared to Traefik's dynamic discovery.


### How to Install Traefik

Not enough with Caddy or Caddy?

Have a look to **Traefik**

We can also get SSL certificates thanks to LetsEncrypt.

And it also provides a UI dashboard.

* https://github.com/traefik/traefik
* https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/user-guides/docker-compose/basic-example/


* **Strengths:**
    * **Dynamic Configuration:** Traefik excels at automatically discovering and configuring services based on service discovery mechanisms like Docker, Kubernetes, and Consul.
    * **Extensive Plugin Ecosystem:** Offers a wide range of plugins for various use cases, including authentication, rate limiting, and middleware.
    * **Ease of Use:** Relatively easy to set up and configure, especially with dynamic configurations.
* **Weaknesses:**
    * **Configuration Complexity:** While dynamic configuration is a strength, it can also lead to complex configurations for more advanced setups.
    * **Performance:** May not be as performant as Nginx for very high-traffic scenarios.

{{< details title="More about Caddy Reverse Proxy ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

This report summarizes a YouTube video by Blue Hippo that demonstrates how to set up a reverse proxy and automatically enable SSL using Caddy and Docker Compose. 

**Key Steps:**

* **Environment Setup:**
    * Create a directory and a Caddyfile for configuration.
    * Use Docker Compose to manage containers, networks, and configurations.
    * Define a Docker network for containers.
* **Caddy Configuration:**
    * Configure the Caddyfile with email, domain, and reverse proxy settings.
    * Enable SSL certificates using Let's Encrypt.
* **Network and DNS:**
    * Open necessary ports (80 and 443) on the network.
    * Configure DNS with a wildcard host or specify each subdomain.

**Benefits:**

* Efficiently manage multiple containers/applications on a single domain.
* Automatically enable SSL certificates for secure connections.
* Flexible DNS configuration options (wildcard or specific subdomains).


{{< /details >}}

1. Docker
2. NGINX to serve a website
3. Traefik providing SSL with your Domain



{{< callout type="info" >}}
To validate that we own the domain, we can do **DNS or TLS Challenge** (this one requires Port FWD)
{{< /callout >}}

For the **DNS Challenge**, we just need the API access.

With that, LetsEncrypt will login to the Domain registrar and creates a temporary record.

Then, it will know that you are the one that really own the domain and therefore you can get certificates for that domain.

**How to get API Token from Cloudflare**

Go to My Profile on the top right -> `API Tokens` -> `Create Token` -> Select the Edit Zone DNS Template

Keep Permissions Zone:DNS And as Zone Resources you can specify the particular domain (optional).

You will get a way to verify it works:

```sh
curl -X GET "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/user/tokens/verify" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer some-cf-token" \
     -H "Content-Type:application/json"
```

You can use that API into the **Traefik docker-compose below** at `CF_DNS_API_TOKEN`

See that we also have a `traefik.yml` linked in the volumes of this compose.

And the docker network:

```sh
sudo docker network create proxy
```

Acme files can be blank, we will fill `traefik.yml`

```sh
mkdir -p ./docker/traefik && \
touch ./docker/traefik/acme.json && \
touch ./docker/traefik/acme.yml && \
touch ./docker/traefik/traefik.yml
```

```sh
chmod 600 ./docker/traefik/acme.json && \
chmod 600 ./docker/traefik/traefik.yml #or it will be a security risk for other users to see the privatekey
```

With such info:

```yml
