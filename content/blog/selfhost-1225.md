**Tl;DR**

{{< dropdown title="Pre-Requisites!! Just Get Docker 🐋" closed="true" >}}

Important step and quite recommended for any SelfHosting Project - [Get Docker Installed](https://fossengineer.com/docker-first-steps-guide-for-data-analytics/)

It will be one command, this one, if you are in Linux:

```sh
apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sh get-docker.sh && docker version
```
