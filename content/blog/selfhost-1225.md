**Tl;DR**

A random server for ~4$/month is all you need.

**Intro**

I tend to get inspired with this kind of [vm and containers that im running](https://blog.networkprofile.org/vms-and-containers-i-am-running-2023/) posts.

As I played with PaaS, wanted to proove how easy and quick is to set them into a VPS for ~4$/month.

We all need to tell data stories sometimes: https://blog.excalidraw.com/tell-your-story-with-charts/ 

Even before jumping to a Streamlit PoC, you can mockup very quickly via Excalidraw, like: https://excalidraw.com/#json=6443031091740672,amxJZJxlZAlUBLADWIukFg

Once everyone is onboard, we can continue and end up with some cool [PBi](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/about-powerbi/) or a [GCP Looker](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/understanding-google-cloud-platform/#what-it-is-looker-modelling-language) Dashboard.

Venn diagrams for data modelling and architecture are also appreciated


Mind your attention, stop auto engage and keep the important things at life first.

## Conclusion

Probably having a **VPS** as compute backup is not a bad idea.

And **[hetzner](https://accounts.hetzner.com/login)** has been leveling up their game: https://docs.hetzner.com/

Keeping NS outside cloudflare and using the NGINX setup, instead of the Traefik one.

Not only [AWS](https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status) will have outages.

But also [cloudflare](https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/)...and [Github](https://www.githubstatus.com/)

Its curious that even X ressited the AWS outage, but not the CF one.

So that makes me think on the reliability of the wedding setup with R2.

And im glad I tried the captcha via CapJS here.

If you have a NAT and use Cloudflare tunnels, maybe is time to try Pangolin as a Plan B.

**Tl;DR**

2 years ago I put together couple of words with thoughts and snapshots that the world never got to see.

Now I have 3 ebooks ready to be consumed, while the world ends *one more time*

**Intro**

I started this ebook because everything has potential failures

{{< dropdown title="Pre-Requisites!! Just Get Docker 🐋" closed="true" >}}

Important step and quite recommended for any SelfHosting Project - [Get Docker Installed](https://fossengineer.com/docker-first-steps-guide-for-data-analytics/)

It will be one command, this one, if you are in Linux:

```sh
apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sh get-docker.sh && docker version
```

# Traefik Proxy

Traefik 3 and FREE Wildcard Certificates with Docker

https://technotim.live/posts/traefik-3-docker-certificates/


We have already seen how to use PiHole and Cloudflare Tunnels.

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liV3c9m_OX8&t=723s>

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b83S_N1kkJM>

SSL will be provided by Cloudflare instead of let's encrypt.

We could use DuckDNS, but our home public ip address would be exposed.
