## DJI Tello Python

I have [forked](https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy) and created a Docker Image with Python Code which is able to control the drone:
* https://github.com/JAlcocerT/DJITelloPy

So far it can do the following:

1. Test Setup
2. Keyboard Control
3. Camera (Photo/Video) Control
4. Computer Vision with DJI Tello

Credits to [Murtaza's YT Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmEcyQnfpDA&t=1286s) that helped to get started.
