It not just about *old school* [BI Tools](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/setup-bi-tools-docker/), or the well known propietary ones like [Looker](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/understanding-google-cloud-platform/) or PBi

Today, we will have a look to:

* **ChartDB**: A database diagrams editor that lets you visualize and design your database with a single query.
* **Quix (wix-incubator)**: A powerful, open-source platform for data exploration and analysis.
* **Querybook**: Pinterest's open-source big data ad-hoc query and visualization tool.
* **Quix Streams**: A Python library designed for building real-time data streaming applications.

### ChartBrew

  * https://docs.chartbrew.com/deployment/run-on-docker#run-on-docker
  * https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chartbrew/chartbrew/refs/heads/master/docker-compose.yml

>  Open-source web platform used to create live reporting dashboards from APIs, MongoDB, Firestore, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and more ðŸ“ˆðŸ“Š 

Which resonates with my recent [post on **BI Tools**](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/setup-bi-tools-docker/)

### ChartDB


I thought everything was done with [LangChain querying DBs with LLMs](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/langchain-chat-with-database/) in DAG mode.

Then I found this:
