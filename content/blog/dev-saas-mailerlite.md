**Tl;DR**

Get a view is trivial with millions of brains dumb scrolling.

Getting a like is easy.

You will get followers.

Would you be able to influence someone?

Do they like you enough to have a 1:1 information exchange?

Or they just see your content in between ads?

**Intro**

Apparently, there are many digital creators.

Its strange that people look at you asking if by having blog you meant instagram.
