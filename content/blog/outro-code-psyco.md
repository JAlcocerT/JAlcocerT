**Tl;DR**

Thoughts after this theo video, shipping a micro-saas in front of people and doing some tech talks.

**Intro**

Everything can be done with code and llms/agents are pretty good with that.

So...why arent we.

Product, how's and features matter.

But so that's the packaging.

The UI/X, the presentation, the how easily is to understand what you do or you dont do.

Lets get better and close the gap.

## Some Context

One more time, a series of ~~un~~connected ~~chaotic~~ events.

And some questions: *that thing that happens when you create*

1. What are my products missing?
2. *If the features are so great*, why dont people want them?
3. How could my tech talk generate more engagement?

### After Shipping

When you bring [eyes to your saas](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/bring-eyes-to-your-saas/)

You might realize that [it needs some improvements](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/iterating-and-improving-a-micro-saas/).

### Psyco

If you have ever [wondered about psychology](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/psychology-skills-data-analytics/).

So...wait.

To improve all that, I need to get **the psychologycal stack** at the same level than the technical one.

From the example of one of my last tech talks, here is what it came out: *mermaidjs powered [here](https://mermaid.live/edit#pako:eNpdVF1v20YQ_CuLeygS1HIVWR-xUBRQJDc1YMOs5TpAoJcTuaQWOt6ye0cnjOH_3qUcmVTfqNnb2bmZPT2blDM0c1OSz0pbbTyAMMd37xLBgD7aSOx_38pvfyShSXfsuGjev2-PAVyV3Fatg7-Y968YQCK8dVjCoqwc5ZQeGI5FgPXOCmZw5bFseqiz6R5Wt5BY8pAw-Xgs3lC5pVQbCltgiV0B4GGH8GXXQE4SenBSS8UBgZ9Q4IYLSo-1JfsoNsS2k6U5ZVpXVvaOPHbwl52NcB3gKbx-Lrl2GXz6eWIRo8rR273ysjs2fkUqrHjaw1WeY9qTdlehV0lchQ77x6vV7J7UldsmROx0rdHlg8_oUf5vIqctlMLfNYa21KNb1BnFVvFawzsxLBEqbdrAL3CPKfq0d_-Ev6lXrTryRZ8sbdkHd0LKowKXjkN3YsmFp0hPqLgVim-Eq1qXYsmZHu24Him08K_wiLK1rivcopSWMliRLcSWb-Pva6ch5hqOYC-UxKrv4ttLvM7vO_NJ2P_AwZrUTxl8Zpd12R_F3rDNenTChQYQ2sqKQqo3rKU37nGwdKTLufDqXs9r7cvbtsMDeJC628DrrF2L2MDCUeFPVzYRW5SH6O4x18ueOLRqvCIp3N3ftgEudeW2_NasoZOO0rmcdz1Lq5u-jho69nJ7oBIHkQfrHVXwaB1lJxv0pxWVbH3IUXreLWC9J-cCRIbFdTuprGKP9eo7pnW0-rxV_b81yWG9gjkzhVBm5lFqPDPla5z6p_Lctm5M3Om5jZnrZ4a5rV3cmI1_0bbK-q_M5bFTuC52Zp5bF_RXXalo_LkUb6igz1D0Ifpo5pPJ9EBi5s_mu5kPRqPx-XA6m8wuL6bD4WQ2mp2Zxsw_jCbnF5ez8XSildlw-vHi5cz8OAz-cD7-eDkejRSbDkfj8eXFy38FxZK0)*

As you can imagine, this goes as: `can we now have a community chat slack alert the date before alert and the 1h before?`

## Whats the catch?

You are missing parts.

### Improving your Presentations

0. Tinker & be willing to share
1. Mind the brand
2. Prepare the `slides.md`
3. Make a ppt-review
4. Prepare a mail communication
5. Prepare engaging slack/follow ups notifications

Why to do so?

because you improve your brand: *specially if you have the same repo for your consulting landing, that where you store the ppts*

```sh
#npx slidev build --base /presentations/ba-brd/ --out dist-ba-brd
npm run build
mkdir -p public/presentations && cp -r y2026-tech-talks/2-ba-brd-development/dist public/presentations/ba-brd
```


#### Improving your emails

#### Improving Slack Engagement


### Improving your Products

Leave them be for a while to get volume/repetitions on their current state.

Done?

Ok, now lets tweak with some sense that it sgoing to move into a better direction.

    %% 3. The Linear Flow

    %% Styling
    style G fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
    style Start fill:#bbf
    style F fill:#e1f5fe
```

#### The Copy

If you have be smart and make so that your full micro-SaaS copy is in one file, like: `copy.md`

You can have inmediate feedback from any LLM, like gemini on how **and why** you can tweak a certain title/cta/whatever.

#### Product emails

Want to increase LTV?

Make sure that your potential client remembers that you are there to help them.
