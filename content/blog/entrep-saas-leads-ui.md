**Tl;DR**

Oil, aka `CL=F` is a commodity

Your client's money is a commodity.

Your [client is a commodity](https://youtu.be/O_tmZgs4LHU).

Your product is NOT.

**Intro**

For custom products im starting to let clients do their own quote.

Shoot an unresonably low number and I already know that you are not making enough money with my solutions.

So why should we loose time?

Should we spend time discussing about building something that wont have impact? that will be used 3 times?

Im just sorry for those who underestimate other's opportunity costs.

Specially for the ones that have been pushing their assets/brands for some time already.

For the rest: **How about we find people who can potentially benefit of what you have created?**

Making UI wrapper around things is so easy this year.

We've seen that around the langchain qna to dbs.

And now, time for more APIFY:

{{< /cards >}}

### Use APIFY to the Max

Every business needs clinets.

Building something that does precisely that: has potential demand.

Plus you can use the product...to...sell the product.

And if you are here, there are [people that has been around this idea already](https://forocoches.com/foro/showthread.php?t=10574345).

Also [here](https://forocoches.com/foro/showthread.php?p=507148447#post507148447), around a google map scrapper `https://app.quickscrape.net/google-maps-scraper/`

### Store your B2B leads
