**Tl;DR**

I let go most of my ,first ten' clients saying: *from next year you put the price for the custom cool app you said you needed and deserved so much*.

Guess what happened as I didnt put the effort to find the right avatar.

Yes, I need to find new customers :)


**Intro**

We come from the [sales pipeline *v1 post*](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/apify/), also with APIFY.

Knowing how to get clients is a must skill if you are building: *if you got more vibe coded webaps and repos in github than actual client, stay*

But also if you want to build sth that can help others: *ive met people doing $$$ ,just' by selling leads*

And...I know, you can post on social media how great you are - Same as everybody does.

Including those that are 'all about frontend' and are LITERALLY one paycheck away from living under the bridge.

Or...expecting to be rescued from your taxes.

Like the ones you will be generating after getting leads right for your SaaS by following this post.

> Dont blame them, they deserve such lifestyle

> > PS: in their eyes, you dont :)

## How has this happened?

As always, a series of tinkering steps.

### Tested n8n automations

And APIFY has a good integration for n8n.

![alt text](/blog_img/selfh/automation/n8n-apify.png)

Check that out if you have an [automation agency](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/pro-agency-automation/#n8n-x-apify).

### Sales Pipeline 101

Where I was testing [APIFY fantastic API](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/apify/).

It was all thank to [a 123 meeting](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/software-for-marketing-agencies/#apify-can-do-that) with marketers

## Conclusions

This is all from the start doing goal for this year: *Go all-in to find new clients*

Pros say they its all about: disqualifying, more than qualify everyone is what makes you earn money.

DOnt follow your passion.

Dont find a public for a given product.

Do reverse: detect a public (avatar, a profile) that can be segmented in an easy way and find out what they want to buy.

> We wont low friction, but SOME friction

This will potentially fill my *DWY pipeline*.

The one created [here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/selling-with-a-landing-website/#conclusions).

One year *aka 12 months* is what you need to change your business and life.

Ive seen it happen: *Programming marketing and sales is all you need*

```sh
whois genkinfy.com | grep -i -E "(creation|created|registered)"
```

Want this implemented for your business?

Or prefer to keep your Ego safe vs take this bet and see if people/b2B want your services?

### What are my plans around client adquisition

I will use this mainly for two projects:

1. [The weddings](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/bring-eyes-to-your-saas/) B2B flow (B2C goes the ad route)
2. The custom real estate web/app as a *high ticker* with [custom demo emailed to potential clients](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/moi-realestate-pro-astro-bot/blob/master/z-sales-automation.md) 
3. The Gen-AIBI [on demand data analytics](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/langchain-db-ui/blob/master/Z_PGSQL-GenBI/sales.md) thats coming
4. People need clients, so an UI wrapper around this will be valuable on its own :)

Stay tuned. 

The year has just started.
