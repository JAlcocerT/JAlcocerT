**Tl;DR**


**Intro**

We come from the [sales pipeline *v1 post*](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/apify/), also with APIFY.

Knowing how to get clients is a must skill if you are building: *if you got more vibe coded webaps and repos in github than actual client, stay*

But also if you want to build sth that can help others: *ive met people doing $$$ ,just' by selling leads*

And...I know, you can post on social media how great you are - Same as everybody does.

Including those that are 'all about frontend' and are LITERALLY one paycheck away from living under the bridge.

Or...expecting to be rescued from your taxes.

Like the ones you will be generating after getting leads right for your SaaS by following this post.
