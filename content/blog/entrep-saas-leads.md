**Tl;DR**

I let go most of my ,first ten' clients saying: from next year you put the price for the custom cool app you said you needed and deserved so much.

Now, I need to find new customers :)

**Intro**

We come from the [sales pipeline *v1 post*](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/apify/), also with APIFY.

Knowing how to get clients is a must skill if you are building: *if you got more vibe coded webaps and repos in github than actual client, stay*

But also if you want to build sth that can help others: *ive met people doing $$$ ,just' by selling leads*

And...I know, you can post on social media how great you are - Same as everybody does.

Including those that are 'all about frontend' and are LITERALLY one paycheck away from living under the bridge.

Or...expecting to be rescued from your taxes.

Like the ones you will be generating after getting leads right for your SaaS by following this post.

> Dont blame them, they deserve such lifestyle

## Conclusions

This is all from the start doing goal for this year: *Go all-in to find new clients*

Pros say they its all about: disqualifying, more than qualify everyone is what makes you earn money.

DOnt follow your passion.

Dont find a public for a given product.

Do reverse: detect a public (avatar, a profile) that can be segmented in an easy way and find out what they want to buy.

> We wont low friction, but SOME friction

This will potentially fill my *DWY pipeline*.

The one created [here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/selling-with-a-landing-website/#conclusions).

One year *aka 12 months* is what you need to change your business and life.

Ive seen it happen:

```sh
whois genkinfy.com | grep -i -E "(creation|created|registered)"
```

Want this implemented for your business?
