**Tl;DR**

By the end of this year, I will have created a **web/ook platform** to share the learnings along the years.

As I dont expect people to have the patience to get value by reading from these 300+ posts - Im destilling that into 20/30 pages ebooks.

The aim is to enhance the DIY offer, *for people that are not ready for [the DWY one](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/selling-with-a-landing-website/#vibe-coding-an-astro-ssr-landing-page)*.

+++ Special section for astro ~ typography themes + DecapCMS

**Intro**


This post is going to be avolving along 2026.

So consider it a WIP until the year has ended - or AI took over civilization :)

Thinking about this...ive been writing for a while (quite intensively last year) and this have become some kind of a habit and...a lead nurture in a way.

With this post (and year), my goal is to recap and distilled all this experience into 20/30 pages ebooks that anyone can benefit from.

And yes, this is going to help shapping a lead magnet for my next product.

The **launch strategy**: *aka, focus strategy*

| Element | Decision |
| :--- | :--- |
| **One Avatar** | |
| **One Product** | |
| **One Channel** | |

The **Tier of Service**: DIY (1a - *leverages on my knowledge & experience, not in actual tools Ive built, neither my time*)

The **customer segmentation**: B2C

The **tech stack**:

| Requirement | Specification | Clarification / Decision |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend Framework** | | |
| **Styling/UI Library** | | |
| **[Backend](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/docs/dev/fe-vs-be/)/Database** | | |
| **[Authentication](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/docs/dev/authentication/)** | | |



## The journey to create N books

After having a custom learning journey and putting together this:

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/cool-ebooks//" title="eBooks | Docs ↗" icon="book-open" >}}
  {{< card link="https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/docs/coolresources/diagrams_ppts/" title="Diagrams and PPTs | Docs ↗" icon="book-open" >}}  
{{< /cards >}}

{{% steps %}}

### Consumed a lot of books

Ive used the kindle a lot.

Peaking at [2023 with 20+ read books](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/blog/summary23/) in that year.


### Created a lot of notes

That I almost ever looked back again.

Not to say how much I actioned upon them.


### Wrote 300+ posts

Totally open posts, which anyone can fork and copy paste - *GL/HF*.

My learning journey, as chaotic as it gets. 

### Time to distill knowledge

When I have actually learnt and created some drafts/PoCs with it, noticed the need of several summaries/recaps.

I created those via posts at first: https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/blog/

Then, as docs: https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/docs/


### How I Build my ebooks

Last year, I decided it was time to order everything, so tinker with ebook creation in few posts and repos.

https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/whats-boostrap/#too-much-info--ebooks_ideas
https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/things-as-a-code/#ebooks-as-a-code
https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/kindle-clippings-knowledge-base/

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/ebook-ideas" title="eBook Ideas ↗" icon="github" >}}
  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/sell-your-ebook" title="Sell your eBook ↗" icon="github" >}}
{{< /cards >}}


If you do on this repo:

```sh
#git clone https://github.com/JAlcocerT/JAlcocerT
find . -type f -iname "*.pdf"
```

You will find interesting things on this repo - Yes, some drafts!

They were create with the learnings from [this post, bc code is everything](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/things-as-a-code/#you-can-do-what-with-pdf).

Is just that...you have to...do it.

Sucks, I know.

### Went HandsOn Obfuscation 

I created the first draft of an ebook on *how to create your cool website via DIY* - `diy.jalcocertech.com`

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="https://diy.jalcocertech.com/" title="DIY Website eBook" image="/blog_img/dev/fastapi/ebook-obfuscate-ui.png" subtitle="JAlcocerTech DIY Series | Ebook to create a Website for your brand" >}}
  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/obfuscate" title="DIY Web eBook x Obfuscation" image="/blog_img/apps/gh-jalcocert.svg" subtitle="Source code on GH. eBook x fastAPI x obfuscator x markdown source" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

But not only once. 

Also with the DIY Landing Boilerplate!

### Noted down couple of Themes

### Now - Decap x Typography x N ebooks

What if launcing ebooks was all about writing via DecapCMS?

Because the landing part is so much clear.

<!-- ### The Echo Chambers

When society embraces disruptive new scientific theories, philosopher Thomas Kuhn explains that such changes demand a “paradigm shift”: People must debate and agree upon a new narrative before replacing the old one. 

Today, however, people often only engage with those who share their opinions. Digital channels have returned humans to a cave-like existence: Only a small social bubble within an echo chamber shares a given person’s view of reality.

“The multiplicity of digital channels allows us to avoid self-awareness and surround ourselves with the people (or machines, it is not always certain) who share our opinions.” 

Individuals that hold opposing viewpoints on reality encourage, criticize, and adjust one another's ideas, influencing economic and human behavior.

Different narratives, like an epidemic, may infect and alter communities, according to Shiller. 

The validity of a narrative has no bearing on its "contagion rate." 

Viral tales capture attention, look cohesive, and fit readily into existing narratives.

## Building N ebooks for a web/ook

### The DIY Web ebook

AI is much better at code than it is to draf-n-drop.

So if you know which tools to ask for, you get much better results.

But hey, if you want to still spend a weekend to get a crappy looking wordpress - feel free to do so.

## Conclusions


### Decap x Existing Astro x LocalHost

I got to get working decap-cms with astro at [this post](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/open-source-minimalist-websites/#using-decap-cms):

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Portfolio" title="Hugo Lynx Portfolio x Decap Github ↗" icon="github" >}}
  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Twilight" title="Twilight Astro x Decap Localhost ↗" icon="github" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

And this was the result of the local editor: *which is totally open sourced*

Which is a much better tool to leverage than trying to build your own flask based cms https://github.com/JAlcocerT/hugo-theme-gallery-flasked


### DecapCMS x VPS

**Initially**, I was thinking on this kind of setup, with some TinyAuth as middleware:

<!-- ![TinyAuth UI with https](/blog_img/selfh/https/TinyAuth/tinyauth-https-ui.png) -->

{{< /cards >}}

```

But ***now** I needed to rethink that with a **simpler architecture**:

* Editing via one subdomain and the Hugo Dev container, like: `https://portfolio.jalcocertech.com/admin`
* Consuming via the CI/CD statically deployed artifacts: `https://jalcocert.github.io/Portfolio/`
  *  *This could be any other custom sub/domain or use cloudflare pages and workers if desired*
  * Or...to trigger the build of the prod container to serve the assets

### From SaaS to LifeTime Products 

Some of the first people on doing SaaS are coming back to the product way of selling (pay once, own forever).

Im talking about: https://once.com/writebook

Info products and one time payment artifacts are a thing today.

https://github.com/mrwyndham/pocketbase-stripe
https://www.fastpocket.dev/pricing

also

https://quickdeploy.dev/
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Feauj4OaePg

With life time access

Pay me to save you time, kind of a mix of ~DIY/DWY/DFY in a package

> But leaning towards enhanced DIY with my expertise kind of thing

#### Doing > Watching

You might be tempted to fall into **the learning trap**.

Learning, batches, small dopamine spikes and...no real output.

To get those you can go to `https://www.classcentral.com/` or `datacamp` without a particular aim.

And learning bc the sake of it - its fantastic on its own.

But if you want to build something - just learn what you need to accomplish it.

This is why Im launching **my first lifetime product** - A boiler plate for creators to ship asap.

Not going to lie: ive got inspired by `https://supersaas.dev/` and `https://shipfa.st/?ref=indiepage` and `https://readmake.com/`

https://www.ohansemmanuel.com/books/understanding-astro

https://understanding-astro-webook.vercel.app/


Im **launching my boilerplate**: https://boilerplate.jalcocertech.com

> It has the look and feel of my latest [diy landing boilerplate](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/diy-landing-boilerplate) for a reason :)

#### Story Telling

<!-- 
Data storytelling in analytics is important because it helps to uncover insights from data that might otherwise go unnoticed, and also helps to communicate those insights to others in a more engaging and memorable way. By presenting data in the form of a narrative, we can make the insights more relatable and understandable to a wider range of people. This is especially important in the world of business, where decisions need to be made based on data and insights, but not everyone may have the technical expertise to fully understand the underlying data.

Furthermore, data storytelling has been shown to be more effective at communicating insights and influencing decisions than simply presenting data in a spreadsheet or chart. By providing context and meaning to the data, data storytelling can help decision-makers better understand the implications of the data and make more informed decisions based on those insights. Overall, data storytelling is a powerful tool that can help organizations unlock the full potential of their data and use it to drive better decision-making and business outcomes. -->

<!-- 
story telling with data
 -->

<!-- In your analytics career, 
 -->

<!-- Data interacts with narratives and systems in the following ways:

* Data shapes a strategic narrative – Whether you’re segmenting customers or developing brand stories, data provides context to shape and share stories.
* Data visualizations deliver the story – In formats such as data journalism, data-inspired social media campaigns and analyst reports, organizations use data visualizations to deliver powerful stories.
* Data provides macro insights – Humans or AI interpret big-picture patterns in data to form an insight, which provides the basis for a story.
* Data shapes processes – Using visually prepared data – via dashboards – systems emerge that enable the control of workflows, processes and states by detecting anomalies and monitoring systems.
