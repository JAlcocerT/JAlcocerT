## Business Analysis: Planning and Monitoring for Success

This essential aspects of planning and monitoring business analysis activities, emphasizing the importance of a structured approach for achieving project goals.

### Planning the Business Analysis Approach

Planning the business analysis approach involves selecting a suitable methodology and defining the activities, tasks, and deliverables.  Two primary approaches exist:

* **Predictive:** Focuses on upfront planning and minimizing ambiguity.  Suitable when requirements can be clearly defined beforehand, risk is low, or stakeholder involvement is challenging.  Emphasizes control and a well-defined solution before implementation.
* **Adaptive:** Emphasizes iterative development and delivering value quickly.  Accepts greater uncertainty in the final solution.  Ideal for exploratory projects or incremental improvements.

The choice between predictive and adaptive depends on the project's *tolerance for uncertainty*, complexity, scale, and risk.

**Factors Influencing Complexity:**

* Size of the change
* Number of affected business areas or systems
* Geographic and cultural considerations
* Technical complexities

**Factors Influencing Risk:**

* Business analyst's experience and domain knowledge
* Stakeholder communication skills and attitudes
* Stakeholder time commitment
* Pre-selected frameworks, methodologies, and tools

### Planning Stakeholder Engagement

Effective stakeholder engagement is crucial.  Understand who the relevant stakeholders are, what you need from them, what they need from you, and how best to collaborate.  Consider:

* Timing and frequency of collaboration
* Location (physical or virtual)
* Available tools (wikis, online communities)
* Delivery methods (in-person, virtual)
* Stakeholder preferences

### Planning Business Analysis Governance

Establish clear governance processes to ensure consistent and informed decision-making. This includes:

* Requirements management
* Business analysis risk management
* Resource allocation

Define how information (requirements, designs) will be captured, stored, and managed for long-term use.  This includes:

* **Change Request Process:**  Specify how changes are requested, when they can be submitted, who can submit them, and how they are communicated.
* **Change Request Elements:** Define the information required for change requests:
    * Cost and time estimates
    * Benefits justification
    * Risk assessment
    * Priority level
    * Alternative courses of action

### Identifying Business Analysis Performance Improvements

* **Document Analysis:** Reviewing existing organizational assets.
* **Estimation:** Determining activity durations.
* **Financial Analysis:** Evaluating the financial impact of different approaches.
* **Functional Decomposition:** Breaking down complex processes.
* **Interviews:** Gathering information from individuals or small groups.
* **Item Tracking:** Monitoring issues and risks.
* **Lessons Learned:**  Leveraging past experiences.
* **Process Modeling:** Defining and documenting the approach.
* **Reviews:** Validating the chosen approach.
* **Risk Analysis and Management:** Assessing and mitigating risks.
* **Scope Modeling:** Defining project boundaries.
* **Surveys/Questionnaires:** Gathering broad input.
* **Workshops:** Collaborative planning sessions.
