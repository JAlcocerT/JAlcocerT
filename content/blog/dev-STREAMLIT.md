## Streamlit Calculator and GenAI RE Agent

I was building a simple web app RE calculator with Streamlit here:

Its time to put few pieces together, and add Generative ai capabilities:

### The AI Tech Stack

1. **RAGs**: LlamaIndex, Mem0 together with HuggingFaceEmbedding(model_name="BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5")

2. **LLMs**: OpenAI, [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/all-models)

```sh
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-yourapikey #https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-yourapi #https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
```

I have also been tinkering with a Web App framework alternative, Reflex:

# Streamlit Features for PoC

You will need **https** to have credibility that you build something solid.

### Features under a Wall

So far, Ive come across few ways (x4) to place **authentication on top of Streamlit Apps**:

1. The `st.login` built in feature: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/user/st.login

#### Provided Users and Pass

2. By using the `streamlit-authenticator` library, only my client can access it:

Its all about: https://pypi.org/project/streamlit-authenticator/

With this method, you can have several hardcoded user/passwords created!

#### Email Verification

Recently I got to know also about this project to verify emails:

* https://rapid-email-verifier.fly.dev/

> MIT | Privacy-first, Free, **Open Source email verifier**


{{< details title="How to use Rapid Email Verifier? ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

3. You can also do the trick by passing the hard work to a 3rd party **subscription newsletter**, like `mailerlite`, and you will query its API.

4. Using **Stripe API**: if an user have an active subscription or free tier evalution, it can go ahead and use your Streamlit App

> Points 2 and 3 are features that I have explored with the AIssistant project:

#### With Other Containers

You're asking for a self-hostable solution that combines frontend *and* user management (registration, login, access control). 

That narrows the options considerably, as most frontend frameworks rely on a separate backend.

Here are some strong contenders, keeping in mind that "self-hostable" implies you control the server:

**1. Keycloak (Identity and Access Management):**

* **Type:**  Full-fledged IAM solution.
* **Pros:**  Very powerful and flexible, supports various authentication protocols (OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, SAML), social logins, multi-factor authentication, fine-grained authorization.  Can act as your authentication server.
* **Cons:**  Can be complex to set up and configure, requires Java knowledge (as it's built on Java).  It's a dedicated service, so you still need a separate frontend.
* **Frontend Integration:**  You would integrate Keycloak with your chosen frontend framework (React, Vue, Angular, etc.) using its client libraries.  Keycloak provides JavaScript adapters to simplify this.
* **Good for:**  Applications that require robust authentication and authorization, especially if you need single sign-on (SSO) across multiple services.

**2. Supabase (Open Source Alternative to Firebase):**

* **Type:**  Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) that you can self-host (though they also offer a hosted service).
* **Pros:**  Provides authentication, database (PostgreSQL), storage, edge functions, and more.  Easy to use, good documentation.  Has client libraries for various frontend frameworks.
* **Cons:**  Self-hosting requires managing the underlying infrastructure. While open-source, some features might require a paid plan if you use their hosted service.
* **Frontend Integration:**  Supabase provides JavaScript libraries that make it easy to integrate authentication and other backend services into your frontend application.
* **Good for:**  Projects where you need a quick setup with a full backend suite, including user authentication.

**3. Appwrite (Open Source Backend Server):**

* **Type:**  Open-source backend server similar to Supabase.
* **Pros:**  Provides authentication, database, storage, functions, and more.  Focuses on developer experience.  Has client SDKs for various platforms.
* **Cons:**  Relatively newer than Supabase, so the community is still growing.
* **Frontend Integration:**  Appwrite offers SDKs for frontend frameworks, simplifying the integration process.
* **Good for:**  Projects where you need a self-hosted backend with a focus on developer-friendliness.

**4. Self-Hosting a Custom Backend (Node.js, Python/Django/Flask, etc.):**

* **Type:**  You build your own backend.
* **Pros:**  Maximum flexibility and control.
* **Cons:**  Requires significant development effort, you're responsible for all aspects, including security.
* **Frontend Integration:**  Your frontend would communicate with your custom backend via API calls (REST or GraphQL).
* **Good for:**  Projects with very specific requirements that cannot be met by existing solutions, or where you need complete control.  This is generally the most complex path.

**5. Nhost (Open Source Firebase Alternative):**

* **Type:** Open-source platform for building serverless web apps.
* **Pros:** Provides authentication, storage, GraphQL API, and Postgres database.
* **Cons:**  Requires some knowledge of GraphQL.
* **Frontend Integration:**  Nhost provides SDKs for integrating with your frontend.
* **Good for:**  Projects where you need a backend with GraphQL API and serverless functions.

**Recommendation:**

* **For most cases, especially if you're not already deeply invested in a specific backend technology, Supabase or Appwrite are excellent starting points.** They offer a good balance of ease of use and functionality.  They handle the complexities of user authentication and provide you with the tools to quickly integrate it into your frontend.
* **If you need a very robust and flexible IAM solution and are comfortable with the complexity, Keycloak is a powerful choice.**
* **If you have very specific requirements or want complete control, building your own backend is an option, but it's the most time-consuming.**

Remember that even with these self-hostable options, you'll still need to choose a frontend framework (React, Vue, etc.) to build the user interface of your application.  These solutions primarily handle the backend aspects of user management.
