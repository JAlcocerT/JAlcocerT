### Find the Theme Source Code

Github is a good starting point.

You can **take components ideas**, like: `::github{repo="saicaca/fuwari"}`

### Clone The Theme

Make sure you are free to use the theme as per its License and then **clone it**:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Ruben-Winant/astro_spark_template ./astro_template #it has a cool carousel!
cd ./astro_template
rm -rf .git #remove existing git
```

### Try the Theme

```sh
npm run build
npm run dev
```

Web3 architecture represents a revolutionary shift in how we interact with the internet. It offers a decentralized, peer-to-peer alternative to the current centralized web.

At the foundation of Web3 architecture is **blockchain technology**, providing a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof way of recording transactions and data. 

This layer is critical to Web3â€™s ability to enable **trustless** and **permissionless** user interactions. Web3 is not just a technological changeâ€”itâ€™s a revolution, and it needs your help to build it.

However, Web3 is more than just the blockchain layer. It includes a **protocol layer** that enables decentralized storage, messaging, and other key functions required for a fully decentralized web.

On top of these foundational layers, developers create **decentralized applications (dApps)** that leverage Web3 architecture to run without relying on centralized systems. 

If you're not sure how to build dApps, donâ€™t worry! Join us to learn more and become part of this emerging movement.
