## New SelfHosted Apps

### Homarr

**What I like about Homarr**

1. Integrations with other apps: Nextcloud, qbitrorrent, 
2. Weather for location (and forecast)
3. Built in RSS Feed. [Example](https://feeds.feedburner.com/visualcapitalist)
4. Plays well with Home assistant

### Better HTTPs and SSL

Forward Auth

### Immich

My previous go to solution with: Syncthing + PiGallery works perfectly.

But among all the Photo Tools I reviewed recently, Immich is the one I tried with the best mobile app experience.

**What do I like about Immich**?

It provides a very similar experience to Google Photos.

1. Semantic Search and facial recognition

2. Fantastic [mobile apps](https://immich.app/docs/features/mobile-app): android/ios

3. Respects file folder structure ????

4. Also with Map Feature!

5. When you create a new user, they will be prompted to change their password during the first login
