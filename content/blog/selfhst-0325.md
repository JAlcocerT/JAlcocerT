## New SelfHosted Apps

### Homarr

**What I like about Homarr**

1. **Integrations** with other apps: Nextcloud, qbitrorrent, ...

3. Built in RSS Feed. [Example](https://feeds.feedburner.com/visualcapitalist)
4. Plays well with Home assistant

### Better HTTPs and SSL

Forward Auth

### Immich

My previous go to solution with: Syncthing + PiGallery works perfectly.

But among all the Photo Tools I reviewed recently, Immich is the one I tried with the best mobile app experience.

**What do I like about Immich**?

It provides a very similar experience to Google Photos.

1. Semantic Search and facial recognition

2. Fantastic [mobile apps](https://immich.app/docs/features/mobile-app): android/ios

3. Respects file folder structure ????

4. Also with Map Feature!

5. When you create a new user, they will be prompted to change their password during the first login

## Conclusions

### Keep Using

1. Media server: Kodi, Jellyfin? 

If you have a smart tv, probably those are already installed or you can add them

The main difference is that Kodi is a unified server+client application, Jellyfin has the server and the clients separated into different apps. 

Jellyfin will use the CPU, unless you do this trick: https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/administration/hardware-acceleration/amd/

> See how the server (x300) was quite rev doing 1080p video

LocalSend and NewPipe are also interesting Android Apps to consider

2. Portainer vs Dockge
