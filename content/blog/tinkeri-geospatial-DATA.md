## GeoSpatial Data Formats

### GeoJSON

### GPX

Phone apps like Komoot or even [PhyPhox can save the GPS records as GPX files](https://www.leafwindow.com/en/get-gps-log-with-phyphox-and-plot-it-with-wp-gpx-maps-en/)



> With R i learnt about many other formats.

## GoPro Metadata Extraction

* https://github.com/gopro/gpmf-parser

> Parser for GPMFâ„¢ formatted telemetry data used within GoProÂ® cameras.

Hey, but why would you want to...

People do this kind of **cool stuff**:

### Telemetry Overlay

There is a possibility to use paid Programs to create these kind of videos:

> Very interesting how those 390cc and 15cv (77) differ from the 390cc 18 cv (80) and 460cc 22cv (88km/h topspeed)

### Exif and Python with GoPro

```sh
sudo apt-get install libimage-exiftool-perl #install exif
#exiftool -ee ./GX030390.MP4 #you will see it on CLI
exiftool -ee ./GX030390.MP4 > output-GX030390.txt #saves it
```

## FAQ

### DJi Metadata Extraction

The DJi OA5Pro does not have a GPS.

Videos can look like:

<!--

{{< youtube "2ZSDeD3HzHg" >}}

With the [updated firmware](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/dji-oa5pro-firmware-updates/) and **high bit rate**, `1080p30 UW RS` I got With 80% battery:

* 38.9GB total files (every 17.2gb or 1h 12min there is a file reset)
* bitrate 31168 kbps, with an average size of **~3.75MB/s**

```sh
#cp *.MP4 /home/jalcocert/Desktop/oa5pro/
rsync -avP *.MP4 /home/jalcocert/Desktop/oa5pro/ #speeds of ~32mb/s from internal card!

#rm *.LRF #clean if needed LRF
```

## Learn with this one

More power is good.

But speed wont increase that quick.

Remember that the **kinetic energy** of a body goes as: $KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$

Remember that the relationship isn't linear, so these percentages describe the *change* but don't explain the *why* behind the change (as discussed in the previous response about non-linear relationships).

**Calculations:**

* **Percentage Change = (New Value - Old Value) / Old Value * 100%**

**1. 390cc 15 cv (77 km/h) to 390cc 18 cv (80 km/h):**

* **Power Increase:** (18 - 15) / 15 * 100% = 20%
* **Speed Increase:** (80 - 77) / 77 * 100% â‰ˆ 3.9%

**2. 390cc 15 cv (77 km/h) to 460cc 22 cv (88 km/h):**

* **Power Increase:** (22 - 15) / 15 * 100% â‰ˆ 46.7%
* **Speed Increase:** (88 - 77) / 77 * 100% â‰ˆ 14.3%

**3. 390cc 18 cv (80 km/h) to 460cc 22 cv (88 km/h):**

* **Power Increase:** (22 - 18) / 18 * 100% â‰ˆ 22.2%
* **Speed Increase:** (88 - 80) / 80 * 100% = 10%

**Summary Table:**

| Comparison                                 | Power Increase (%) | Speed Increase (%) |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| 15 cv to 18 cv (same cc)                   | 20                | 3.9               |
| 15 cv to 22 cv (different cc)              | 46.7              | 14.3              |
| 18 cv to 22 cv (different cc)              | 22.2              | 10                |

**Important Reminder:**

These percentage increases show the *change* in power and speed, but they *do not* imply a direct, proportional relationship.

Factors like aerodynamic drag, gearing, weight, and other variables play a crucial role, especially at higher speeds.

The smaller speed increase from 15 cv to 18 cv illustrates this pointâ€”even with a 20% power increase, the speed gain was relatively small due to the influence of these other factors.

Also, these are top speed at different days, by different drivers.

Lower temperatures can benefit lap times due to increased engine power, but it's crucial to consider tire temperature. The optimal temperature for the best lap times is a balance between these two factors and can vary depending on the track, kart setup, and driver skill.
