**TL;DR**


**Intro**

THis year i discovered that for simple calculations some JS vibe coded and shipped statically into your browser can do.

You can get [your MRR](https://libreportfolio.pages.dev/recursos/calculadora-mrr/) *super complex* operation done.

Even CAGR or [FIRE calculator](https://libreportfolio.pages.dev/recursos/fire-calculator/) represented and packed as astro component.

But what happens when you need something more complex?

I used Wolfram and Matlab during my studies.





3. Wolfram alfa, but FOSS calculator: <https://www.opensourcealternative.to/project/Kalker>

* https://kalker.xyz

> **MIT** | A scientific calculator that supports math-like syntax with user-defined variables, functions, differentiation, integration, and complex numbers. 

4. See also the [Sympy](https://pypi.org/project/sympy/) Python library for symbolic mathematics

> Matlab had a similar feature, which I used on [this thesis](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Bike_dynamic_simulator)

### SelfHosted Calculators
