### AI Features for PyStocks

Chat with the pulled financial data thanks to [LangChain](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/how-to-use-rags-with-python/#exploring-langchain).



{{< callout type="info" >}}
I was exploring on [this post](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/how-to-chat-with-your-data/#chat-with-a-db-with-langchain) and [related repo](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Data-Chat/tree/main/LangChain), how to use **LangChain as RAG with OpenAI API so that given a DB**, we can use Natural Language to interact with it.

## Conclusions

This goes one step further than the previous [project RStocks](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/R-Stocks/).

And definitely much more than [FlexDashboards](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/guide-r-flexdashboards-in-github-pages/) in R.

### Stock Questions - Answered

* Stocks overperforming SP500 in xyz period / last xyz months
* YoC when I stopped investing at a certain point of time (Dave van Knapp made a all in approach, but it can serve to see what happens after a DCA strategy)

In the meantime, I got to understand [how **French amortization** works](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/python-real-estate-mortage-calculator/#french-amortization-101) (typical for mortage payments).

See, the **French amortization** formula: $A = P \times \frac{r(1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1}$.

I also got time to compare **different SP500 ETFS performance**:

* `LON:SPY5` ([SPY5.L](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY5.L/)) dist usd 0.09% IE00B6YX5C33 [Link to JustETF profile](https://www.justetf.com/es/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00B6YX5C33#dividendos)
* `LON:VUAA`, acc usd 0.07% IE00BFMXXD54 [Link to JustETF profile](https://www.justetf.com/es/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00BFMXXD54#bolsa-de-valores)
* In GSheets, you have the SP500 index under the name `INDEXSP:.INX`

{{< details title="Net Income vs Net Cash Flow ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

**Net Income** is not the same as **Net Cash Flow**.

They are related but measure different aspects of a company's financial health:

**Net Income**:
- Represents a company's **profit or loss** during a specific period.
- Found on the **income statement**.
- Includes both **cash and non-cash items**:
  - Revenues minus all expenses, including non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization.
  - Accrual-based (recognizes income/expenses when they are earned/incurred, not when cash changes hands).

**Net Cash Flow**:
- Measures the **actual cash movement** into and out of the company during a specific period.
- Found on the **cash flow statement**.
- Focuses on **cash inflows and outflows**, ignoring non-cash items!.
- Composed of three parts:
  1. **Operating Cash Flow**: Cash generated from core business activities.
  2. **Investing Cash Flow**: Cash used in or generated by investments in assets.
  3. **Financing Cash Flow**: Cash used for or received from debt, equity, and dividends.


| **Aspect**          | **Net Income**                                   | **Net Cash Flow**                                |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**       | Profit or loss from operations (accounting basis)| Actual cash generated or used (cash basis)      |
| **Non-cash items**   | Includes non-cash items (e.g., depreciation)     | Excludes non-cash items, tracks cash only       |
| **Timing**           | Accrual-based accounting                        | Tracks when cash is received or spent           |
| **Use**              | Measures profitability                          | Measures liquidity and financial flexibility    |

---

**Relationship**:
Net Income is often the starting point for calculating **Operating Cash Flow**.

Adjustments are made to add back non-cash expenses and account for changes in working capital. 


Both metrics are important:
- **Net Income**: Indicates profitability.
- **Net Cash Flow**: Shows the company's ability to generate cash and stay solvent.

### VBA vs OpenPyxl

Okay, let's break down what openpyxl is and how it relates to Excel macros:

**What is openpyxl?**

* **Python Library:**
    * openpyxl is a Python library used to read and write Excel .xlsx files. This means you can use Python code to interact with Excel spreadsheets.
    * It allows you to automate tasks like:
        * Reading data from Excel files.
        * Writing data to Excel files.
        * Modifying existing Excel files (formatting, adding/removing sheets, etc.).
* **Purpose:**
    * It's designed to work with the Office Open XML format, which is the underlying structure of modern Excel files (.xlsx).

**openpyxl vs. Excel Macros (VBA)**

* **Macros (VBA):**
    * Excel macros are created using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), a programming language built into Excel.
    * They are used to automate tasks within Excel itself.
    * Macros are stored within the Excel file.
* **openpyxl (Python):**
    * openpyxl is a Python library that operates externally to Excel.
    * It allows you to manipulate Excel files from your Python scripts.
    * Python code is separate from the Excel file.
* **Key Differences:**
    * **Location:** Macros live inside the Excel file; openpyxl scripts are external.
    * **Language:** Macros use VBA; openpyxl uses Python.
    * **Functionality:**
        * openpyxl excels at data manipulation, formatting, and file structure changes.
        * Macros are often used for automating repetitive tasks within the Excel user interface (e.g., button clicks, custom functions).
    * **Macros and openpyxl interaction:**
        * openpyxl itself does not execute VBA macros.
        * It also does not fully preserve all aspects of macro enabled excel files(.xlsm). There are limitations when attempting to save .xlsm files after they have been worked on by openpyxl.
        * However, you can use Python libraries like `win32com` to interact with Excel's application object and potentially run macros. But this is a different method than openpyxl's native functionality.
* **Can you do similar things?**
    * In many cases, yes, you can achieve similar automation results with openpyxl as you would with macros.
    * For data-centric tasks, openpyxl is often more powerful and flexible due to Python's extensive libraries.
    * For tasks that require direct interaction with the Excel user interface, macros might be more suitable.

**In summary:**

* openpyxl is a powerful tool for working with Excel files programmatically.
* While it doesn't directly replace VBA macros, it provides a robust alternative for many automation needs.
