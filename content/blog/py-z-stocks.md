### AI Features for PyStocks

Chat with the pulled financial data thanks to [LangChain](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/how-to-use-rags-with-python/#exploring-langchain).



{{< callout type="info" >}}
I was exploring on [this post](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/how-to-chat-with-your-data/#chat-with-a-db-with-langchain) and [related repo](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Data-Chat/tree/main/LangChain), how to use **LangChain as RAG with OpenAI API so that given a DB**, we can use Natural Language to interact with it.

## Conclusions

This goes one step further than the previous [project RStocks](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/R-Stocks/).

And definitely much more than [FlexDashboards](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/guide-r-flexdashboards-in-github-pages/) in R.

### Stock Questions - Answered

* Stocks overperforming SP500 in xyz period / last xyz months
* YoC when I stopped investing at a certain point of time (Dave van Knapp made a all in approach, but it can serve to see what happens after a DCA strategy)

In the meantime, I got to understand [how **French amortization** works](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/python-real-estate-mortage-calculator/) (typical for mortage payments).


I also got time to compare **different SP500 ETFS performance**:

* `LON:SPY5` ([SPY5.L](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY5.L/)) dist usd 0.09% IE00B6YX5C33 [Link to JustETF profile](https://www.justetf.com/es/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00B6YX5C33#dividendos)
* `LON:VUAA`, acc usd 0.07% IE00BFMXXD54 [Link to JustETF profile](https://www.justetf.com/es/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00BFMXXD54#bolsa-de-valores)
* In GSheets, you have the SP500 index under the name `INDEXSP:.INX`

{{< details title="Net Income vs Net Cash Flow ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

**Net Income** is not the same as **Net Cash Flow**.

They are related but measure different aspects of a company's financial health:

**Net Income**:
- Represents a company's **profit or loss** during a specific period.
- Found on the **income statement**.
- Includes both **cash and non-cash items**:
  - Revenues minus all expenses, including non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization.
  - Accrual-based (recognizes income/expenses when they are earned/incurred, not when cash changes hands).

**Net Cash Flow**:
- Measures the **actual cash movement** into and out of the company during a specific period.
- Found on the **cash flow statement**.
- Focuses on **cash inflows and outflows**, ignoring non-cash items!.
- Composed of three parts:
  1. **Operating Cash Flow**: Cash generated from core business activities.
  2. **Investing Cash Flow**: Cash used in or generated by investments in assets.
  3. **Financing Cash Flow**: Cash used for or received from debt, equity, and dividends.


| **Aspect**          | **Net Income**                                   | **Net Cash Flow**                                |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**       | Profit or loss from operations (accounting basis)| Actual cash generated or used (cash basis)      |
| **Non-cash items**   | Includes non-cash items (e.g., depreciation)     | Excludes non-cash items, tracks cash only       |
| **Timing**           | Accrual-based accounting                        | Tracks when cash is received or spent           |
| **Use**              | Measures profitability                          | Measures liquidity and financial flexibility    |

---

**Relationship**:
Net Income is often the starting point for calculating **Operating Cash Flow**.

Adjustments are made to add back non-cash expenses and account for changes in working capital. 


Both metrics are important:
- **Net Income**: Indicates profitability.
- **Net Cash Flow**: Shows the company's ability to generate cash and stay solvent.

#### Financial Data Apps

### GSheets Tricks

You can have a simple, yet useful **Google Sheets with Stocks** info:

```sh
=GoogleFinance(S35;"eps") #S35 can reference some ticket, like NYSE:KO
=GoogleFinance(S35;"pe")
=GoogleFinance("INDEXSP:.INX") #sp500

=INDICE(GoogleFinance("INDEXSP:.INX"; "price"; HOY()-365);2;2) #get the price 365 ago

=SPARKLINE(GoogleFinance("CURRENCY:EURCHF"; "price"; HOY()-J$1; HOY()))
=SPARKLINE(GoogleFinance("CURRENCY:"&"USD" & DERECHA(A6;3); "price"; HOY()-J$1; HOY()))
```

And if you need, you can also **import info from other website** sources:

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
You will need to go to inspect -> find the proper div with the info -> copy **full xpath**
These xpath might change if there is a redesign in the website!
{{< /callout >}}


1. Import from ycharts:

```sh
=VALOR(IZQUIERDA(importxml(CONCATENAR("https://ycharts.com/companies/";REGEXEXTRACT(S33;"[^:]*$");"/profit_margin");$AJ$28);3))/100
#S33 is a ticker, NASDAQ:PEP, for example and AJ28 the XPATH
# =importxml("https://ycharts.com/companies/"& REGEXEXTRACT("NASDAQ:PEP";"\:(.*)") & "/profit_margin";$AI$28)
```

> with xpath being `/html/body/div[3]/div[2]/section[1]/div/div/div[1]/div[2]/ul/li[1]/span[2]`

2. Import from numbeo:

```sh
=IZQUIERDA(importxml(C36;C37);6)/IZQUIERDA(importxml(C36;C38);6)
```

With:

* C36 `https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=Poland&country2=spain&city1=Warsaw&city2=barcelona&tracking=getDispatchComparison`
* C37 `/html/body/div[2]/aside[1]/div[2]/div/span[1]/text()`
* C38 `/html/body/div[2]/aside[1]/div[2]/div/span[3]`

3. Even from Etherscan for crypto related info!

```sh
=importxml("https://etherscan.io/address/some_address";"/html/body/main/section[3]/div[2]/div[1]/div/div/div[2]/div/div")
```
