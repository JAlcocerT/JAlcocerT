### Stock Questions - Answered

* Stocks overperforming SP500 in xyz period / last xyz months
* YoC when I stopped investing at a certain point of time (Dave van Knapp made a all in approach, but it can serve to see what happens after a DCA strategy)

In the meantime, I got to udnerstand how **French amortization** works (typical for mortage payments)

{{< details title="More about French Amortization ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

To calculate the French amortization schedule in Python, you need to use a formula that generates a fixed monthly payment throughout the loan term, and then gradually allocates it to both interest and principal.

The formula for calculating the fixed monthly payment is:

\[
M = P \times \frac{r(1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1}
\]

Where:
- \(M\) is the monthly payment
- \(P\) is the principal amount
- \(r\) is the monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12)
- \(n\) is the number of payments (loan term in years multiplied by 12)

Each month, the interest portion of the payment decreases, and the principal portion increases.


**Understanding French Amortization**

French amortization is a loan repayment method where you make equal periodic payments (usually monthly) over a fixed term. Each payment consists of two parts:

1. **Interest payment:** Calculated on the outstanding loan balance.
2. **Principal repayment:** The portion of the payment that reduces the outstanding loan balance.

**Key Characteristics:**

* **Equal periodic payments:** The total amount you pay each period remains constant.
* **Declining interest:** As the loan balance decreases, the interest portion of your payment also decreases.
* **Increasing principal repayment:** Since the total payment is fixed, the portion allocated to principal repayment increases over time.

**Excel Parameters for French Amortization:**

To create an amortization schedule in Excel, you'll need the following parameters:

1. **Loan amount (principal):** The initial amount borrowed.
2. **Interest rate:** The annual interest rate on the loan.
3. **Loan term:** The total number of periods (usually months or years) over which the loan will be repaid.

> See [these functions](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093185?hl=en)

* **PMT(rate, nper, pv):** Calculates the periodic payment amount.
  * `rate`: The periodic interest rate (annual rate divided by the number of periods per year).
  * `nper`: The total number of payment periods.
  * `pv`: The present value of the loan (the amount borrowed).
  * It does not care about the period, as the key about this amortization is that all are the same!

* **IPMT(rate, per, nper, pv, [fv], [type]):** Calculates the interest portion of a specific payment.
  * `rate`, `nper`, `pv`: Same as in the PMT function.
  * `per`: The period for which you want to calculate the interest.
  * `fv`: The future value of the loan (usually 0).
  * `type`: Specifies when payments are due (0 for end of period, 1 for beginning of period).

* **PPMT(rate, per, nper, pv, [fv], [type]):** Calculates the principal portion of a specific payment.
  * Parameters are the same as for IPMT.

{{< details title="Net Income vs Net Cash Flow ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

**Net Income** is not the same as **Net Cash Flow**.

They are related but measure different aspects of a company's financial health:

**Net Income**:
- Represents a company's **profit or loss** during a specific period.
- Found on the **income statement**.
- Includes both **cash and non-cash items**:
  - Revenues minus all expenses, including non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization.
  - Accrual-based (recognizes income/expenses when they are earned/incurred, not when cash changes hands).

**Net Cash Flow**:
- Measures the **actual cash movement** into and out of the company during a specific period.
- Found on the **cash flow statement**.
- Focuses on **cash inflows and outflows**, ignoring non-cash items!.
- Composed of three parts:
  1. **Operating Cash Flow**: Cash generated from core business activities.
  2. **Investing Cash Flow**: Cash used in or generated by investments in assets.
  3. **Financing Cash Flow**: Cash used for or received from debt, equity, and dividends.


| **Aspect**          | **Net Income**                                   | **Net Cash Flow**                                |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**       | Profit or loss from operations (accounting basis)| Actual cash generated or used (cash basis)      |
| **Non-cash items**   | Includes non-cash items (e.g., depreciation)     | Excludes non-cash items, tracks cash only       |
| **Timing**           | Accrual-based accounting                        | Tracks when cash is received or spent           |
| **Use**              | Measures profitability                          | Measures liquidity and financial flexibility    |

**Relationship**:
Net Income is often the starting point for calculating **Operating Cash Flow**.

Adjustments are made to add back non-cash expenses and account for changes in working capital. 


Both metrics are important:
- **Net Income**: Indicates profitability.
- **Net Cash Flow**: Shows the company's ability to generate cash and stay solvent.

You can have a simple, yet useful Google Sheets with Stocks info:

```sh
=GoogleFinance(S35;"eps")
=GoogleFinance(S35;"pe")
```

And if you need, you can also **import info from other website** sources:

```sh
=VALOR(IZQUIERDA(importxml(CONCATENAR("https://ycharts.com/companies/";REGEXEXTRACT(S33;"[^:]*$");"/profit_margin");$AJ$28);3))/100
#S33 is a ticker, NASDAQ:PEP, for example and AJ28 the XPATH
# =importxml("https://ycharts.com/companies/"& REGEXEXTRACT("NASDAQ:PEP";"\:(.*)") & "/profit_margin";$AI$28)
```
