This is way far from my confort zone, yet here we go.

## PocketBase

Despite not been able to code in Go, I really admire few projects already that use Go.

HUGO was the first for me.

And now is time to Pocketbase, also written in Go:

* https://pocketbase.io/
    * https://pocketbase.io/docs/
    * https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase

> MIT | Open Source realtime backend in 1 file 

PB Features:

1. Realtime database
2. Authentication
3. File storage
4. Admin dashboard

While PocketBase **includes** a database, it's more accurate to call it a **backend-as-a-service (BaaS)** or a "realtime backend" rather than *just a database*. 

PocketBase is a single, self-contained Go application that bundles several key components into one executable file:

* **An embedded SQLite database:** This is the core storage engine. So yes, it does contain a database.
* **A RESTful API:** This provides an interface to interact with the data in the database.
* **An authentication system:** It handles user sign-up, login, and authorization.
* **A web-based admin UI:** This allows you to manage your collections, data, and users without writing any code.
* **Real-time subscriptions:** It enables your frontend to listen for live data changes.

Because it provides all of these features out-of-the-box, it's designed to be a full backend for applications, allowing you to build a project without having to set up a separate database server, API, and authentication system.

### PB 101

Spin Pocketbase into your PC building a Go container with the project:

You might need to create **collections in pocketbase**

Overview of Core Data Entities as per https://deepwiki.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/2.2-data-model

The PocketBase data model is built on three primary entities:

1. Collections - Schema definitions that describe the structure of data (similar to tables in traditional databases)
2. Records - Individual data entries stored within collections (similar to rows in a table)
3. Fields - The attributes or properties that define the structure of records (similar to columns)


And you can do so via the UI:

![alt text](/blog_img/dev/PB/pocketbase-collection-ui.png)

You can also try with the demo: https://pocketbase.io/demo/

### Programatic PB Interaction

But you can also do them via scripts.

* https://deepwiki.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/9.2-collection-schema-management

I have made **few samples python scripts** next to the docker configs: https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Docker/tree/main/Dev/BaaS/PB

```sh
cd ./Dev/BaaS/PB
python3 create_user_settings.py
```

> Once executed, Validate within the UI that they are as you wanted it to be: `http://localhost:8080/_/#/collections`

You can also **export the existing collections** into json:

{{< cards cols="1" >}}
  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Docker/blob/main/Dev/BaaS/PB/create_user_settings.py" title="Pocketbase x Py, Collection Creator ‚Üó" >}}
  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Docker/blob/main/Dev/BaaS/PB/export_collections.py" title="Pocketbase x Py, Collections Export ‚Üó" >}}
{{< /cards >}}


To make the code a little bit cleaner, we can have the **collection creator** to get the collection details **from a JSON with the details**, instead of hardcode them.

{{< cards cols="1" >}}
  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Docker/blob/main/Dev/BaaS/PB/create_json_collection.py" title="Pocketbase x Py, Collection JSON Creator ‚Üó" >}}
  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Docker/blob/main/Dev/BaaS/PB/collection_details.json" title="Pocketbase JSON Collection Sample ‚Üó" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

```sh
python3 create_json_collection.py user_settings
make create-specific COLLECTIONS="posts user_settings" #if some exist, it will skip it
```

And I also brought a way to list and delete collections:

```sh
make list-collections
make delete-collection COLLECTIONS="user_settings"
```

We can also export existing collections from the UI, or programatically: See [this md](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Docker/blob/main/Dev/BaaS/PB/SCRIPT_USAGE.md#collection-export)


{{% details title="Full format vs Portable for Recreation... üöÄ" closed="true" %}}

There are two different formats:

üìä Format Comparison:
üî¥ Full Format (what you just exported):
Raw PocketBase API format - exactly as stored in PocketBase
Contains IDs, timestamps, metadata
Relations use collectionId (like "_pb_users_auth_")
Not directly usable for recreation

üü¢ Template Format (for 
create_json_collection.py
):
Clean, portable format - designed for recreation
No IDs or timestamps
Relations use collectionName (like "users")
Directly compatible with your JSON creation system

### PocketBase x Flask

If you are vibecoding, you can get a quick sample [Flask](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/web-apps-with-flask/) Web App connected to Pocketbase as its BE.

Then, it can signup/in users and create posts:

```sh
#https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Docker/tree/main/Dev/BaaS/PB
cd ./Dev/BaaS/PB
uv run flask_pocketbase_app.py 
```

{{< cards cols="1" >}}
  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Docker/blob/main/Dev/BaaS/PB/flask_pocketbase_app.py" title="Pocketbase x Flask WebAp ‚Üó" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

![Flask connected to local PocketBase](/blog_img/dev/PB/flask-pocketbase.png)

It creates a `posts` collection with these fields:

* title (text, required)
* content (editor, required)
* author (text, required)
* published (boolean, default: false)
* tags (select, optional)
* featured_image (file, optional)

![PB collection of the sample Flask WebApp](/blog_img/dev/PB/pb-posts-collection.png)

If you create a post via adding a new record into the posts collection, it will be reflected in the Flask UI.

> It was all one prompt and Claude Sonnet 4 magic...

This can be a quick and local alternative to bring user authentication.

But, even if you ask for the email, it wont be validated.

Unlike [LogTo](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/testing-tinyauth/#logto-authentication) was doing for us properly and out-of-thebox:

![LogTo custom domain auth](/blog_img/dev/PB/logto-custom-domain-auth.png)

### PocketBase x Stripe

### PB x Collections JS

I was wondering how to get specific pb collections initialize from the first moment.

I tried to do some py script that setup the collections I need.

But it seems that there is another way: via `./pb_migrations/*.json` files

* https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-migrations/
* https://deepwiki.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/7-migrations-system

```sh
#docker volume ls
docker volume prune -f
docker volume ls -f dangling=true
docker system df -v

#sudo docker prune
#docker system prune -a
#docker system prune -a --volumes
```

Adding a timestamp string to get trazability:

```sh
touch devops/pocketbase/pb_migrations/$(date +%s)_created_my_collection.js
```
