**Tl;DR**

The **launch strategy**: *aka, focus strategy*:

| Element | Decision |
| :--- | :--- |
| **One Avatar** | |
| **One Product** | |
| **One Channel** | |

The **Tier of Service**: A clear, custom DFY

The **customer segmentation**: SMB

The **tech stack**:

| Requirement | Specification | Clarification / Decision |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend Framework** | | |
| **Styling/UI Library** | | |
| **[Backend](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/docs/dev/fe-vs-be/)/Database** | | |
| **[Authentication](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/docs/dev/authentication/)** | | |


* Supply - DFY, finite *on demand basis*
* Demand - constrained *targeted users via APIFY google maps scrapping + cold emails / social media reach*

But it does not apply, as the goal of this is more closing a long chapter and making the final learnings with it.

As the why, what was very clear, its time to put together the final HOW:

```md
# Project Name: [SaaS Name]

## 1. The Why (BRD)
- **Problem:** [Describe the pain point]
- **Value Prop:** [How I solve it]
- **Monetization:** [e.g., $9/mo Subscription via Stripe]

## 2. The What (PRD)
- **Primary User Flow:** Landing -> Auth -> Core Feature -> Payment.
- **V1 Features:** - [ ] Auth (Google/Email)
  - [ ] Feature A (The core value)
  - [ ] Settings (Billing/Delete account)

## 3. The How (FRD)
- **Stack:** T3 Stack (Next.js, Prisma, TRPC)
- **DB Schema:** - User: id, email, stripe_id
  - Data: id, user_id, content, timestamp
```

**Intro**

You cant be an AI company behore you are a data company.

And before having LLMs to get company context...that context have to be somewhere.

Like in the selfhosted knowledge base I was commenting here.

To make the solution trustless: selfhosted + local .md based + local LLM has to be the way forward.

## The Process to build a ChatBot Platform

{{% steps %}}

### Tinkered with websites

That bus trip to Vilna (to start the Vilnus-Tallin cycling trip) and discovering Astro paid off.

### Used Streamlit to add custom RAG

With a real estate example around a Python Web App.

And made tech talks around it.

### Used Ollama on my HomeLab



### Configured N8N on my VPS

And shared it with a couple marketers.

### Tested all around website embedding

Tested the drag'n'drop chatbots, like Typebot.


### Got tired of cloning astro templates

So started vibe coding mine.

From diy-landings, that you can plug chatbots to DFY real estate soltions.

### Put together a notes about KBs

Because Im a documentation geek and dont like to go over the same twice.

The path is clear once and has to be available to solve future doubts from the team.

### Talked with a friend about this

The potential use case of having companies in house documentation + RAG based QnA to about silos.
