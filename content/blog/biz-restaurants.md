**TL;DR**

QR Restaurantes Free + Web if Pay.


**Intro**

For B2B only as per [this section](#the-how-behind-the-idea).

Scrap on google maps some potential interested business: leads.

The Related: BRD, tech stack, dev phases, sales, more sales and landing psyc

Before you ask: yes, this is using my latest APIFY workflow to find leads and my free web audit.

**The Business side**

The **Tier of Service**: 

Initially, I thought aboyt a DIY product (1b - *leveraging on actual tech stack Ive put together - PaaS x (WP/Ghost or SSG+CMS)*)

But as I dont want to build without real clients asking for it, this starts a a **DFY service**, for those who actually want it.

Plus: validated active income >>> theoretical 'passive income' without OpEx.

## Conclusions

A set of **sites themes** that will take a while to get outdated:

1. Restaurants / Reservations
2. [Real Estate](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/real-estate-website/) Sites
3. Portfolio Links / Bento
4. Photo Galleries / "Pretending Sites"
5. [Wedding Sites](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/web-for-moto-blogger/) (and related [software for weddings](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/software-for-weddings/))

### The HOW behind the idea

Starting with my latest [business skeleton here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/ideas-and-opportunities-health-check/).

Understand that **who** you sell to (Niche) dictates **what** you sell (Offer) and **how** you find them (Leads).

| Element | Decision |
| :--- | :--- |
| **One Avatar** | |
| **One Product** | |
| **One Channel** | One of the ,Core-4': Warm OutReach / Free Content / Cold OutReach / Paid Ads |
| The Lead Magnet | Strategy Type: , Delivery Method: |

The Matrix: *Strategy vs. Medium for leads*

| Strategy (The 3 Types) | Software Delivery | Information Delivery | Service Delivery | Physical Delivery |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Reveal the Problem** | A "Profit Leak" Calculator. | A "Red Flag" PDF Checklist. | A Free 5-Min Security Audit. | A "Water Hardness" Testing Kit. |
| **2. Give a Sample** | 7-Day Trial of a CRM. | A Free Masterclass Lesson. | A 15-Min Mini-Consult. | A Trial-Sized Supplement. |
| **3. Step 1 of N** | A template pre-loaded in an app. | A "How to Set Up Your LLC" Guide. | A "Done-for-you" Website Header. | A "Starter Tool" (e.g., a free brush for a paint kit). |

The **Tier of Service**: DFY *because The value ladder is a thing*

The **fundamental nature of the business model** and its primary bottleneck

| Feature | **Guest Photo WebApp** | **Educational Model** | **The Lead Architect Agency** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Business Archetype** | B2C Indie Hacker (SaaS-Lite) | Info-Product / Course |  |
| **Primary Lever** | **Volume** | **Volume** | **Price** |
| **Strategic Tag** | **[GROWTH BET]** | **[GROWTH BET]** | |
| **Customer Intent** | Emotional (Memories) | Aspirational (Success) |  |
| **Execution Risk** | Technical/Server Downtime | Content Obsolescence |  |
| **Main Constraint** | **Demand (Marketing, ads)** | **Demand (Attention)** | **Supply (Expert Hours)** |
| **Macro Winner** | Low-cost luxury (Recession) | Upskilling (Recession) |  |

The **GTM strategy** is a cross-functional roadmap that answers the question: *How will we bring this new product to market successfully?* 

It aligns all key business functions, including:

* **Product:** What are we selling? What problem does it solve?
* **Pricing:** How much will we charge?
* **Distribution/Sales:** How will we get the product into the hands of customers? (e.g., direct sales team, e-commerce, third-party distributors).
* **Marketing:** How will we generate awareness and demand?
* **Customer Success/Support:** How will we onboard and support customers after they buy?
