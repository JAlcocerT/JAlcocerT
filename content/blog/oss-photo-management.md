## Lately...

I have learnt to **export photo frames** from a video (with ffmpeg).

Im still impress that with ffmpeg I dont need to re-render videos, which makes joining them really fast.

> PS: You can also export snapshots with Google photos (at least at this moment)

## FAQ

### Proper Photo BackUps

1. Home SSD
2. Home HDD
3. Cloud

The typical **read and write speeds** for different interfaces are as follows:

| Interface | Read Speed (MB/s) | Write Speed (MB/s) |
|---|---|---|
| USB 3.0 | 60 | 30 |
| USB 3.1 Gen 1 | 5 | 5 |
| USB 3.1 Gen 2 | 10 | 10 |
| USB 3.2 Gen 1x1 | 20 | 20 |
| USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 | 40 | 40 |
| USB 4 | 40 | 40 |
| Thunderbolt 4 | 40 | 40 |
| SATA III | 600 | 600 |
| NVMe PCIe 3.0 x4 | 3500 | 3000 |
| NVMe PCIe 4.0 x4 | 7000 | 6000 |

I have been exploring also **NAS** as a reliable options for home backups.

Synlogy seems to be a good alternative, but...in my opinion its just a PC with couple of 3.5 bays.

Im exploring other options at this point.

> I'd just need the space and Linux with containers!
