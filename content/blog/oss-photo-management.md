{{< callout type="info" >}}
I have added a complete docker stack with these [Selfhostable photo tools **here**](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Docker/blob/main/Z_Dockge/stacks/z_photo_backup/compose.yaml)

### PhotoView

[Photoview](https://fossengineer.com/selfhosting-Photoview-docker/) can be configured with a [docker compose **configuration file**](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Docker/blob/main/Backups/Photos/Photoview_docker-compose.yml)


1. It respects the original folder structure *reads only*
2. Photoview requires a SQL DB, *like MariaDB* or MySQL.

### PiGallery

* https://github.com/bpatrik/pigallery2
  * https://hub.docker.com/r/bpatrik/pigallery2/tags/

> MIT | A fast directory-first photo gallery website, with rich UI, optimized for running on low resource servers (especially on raspberry pi)


1. Web Based. Lightweight and **no DB required**
2. Supports [GPX](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/geospatial-data/) - *See Photos on a Map!*
3. Simple. Read-only. Shows what you have that's it. No gallery changes (photo delete, rotate, enhance, tag...)

**Why do I love PiGallery2**?

* Simplicity: Works perfectly connected to Syncthing/Filebrowser.
* The MAP feature...

## Interesting BackUp Software

### Nextcloud

Nextcloud can do much more than just photo management.

And you can [selfhost NC with docker](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Docker/tree/main/Backups/NextCloud)

You can give it a try to [PhotoQT](https://photoqt.org/) or [digiKam](https://www.digikam.org/about/)

```sh
sudo apt install photoqt
```

## Lately...

I have learnt to **export photo frames** from a video ([with ffmpeg](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/my-action-cam-video-workflow/#quick-videos---ffmpeg-cli)).

Im still impressed that with ffmpeg I dont need to re-render videos, which makes joining them really fast.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Everything **about videos**, is captured [here](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/YT-Video-Edition)
{{< /callout >}}

> PS: You can also export snapshots with Google photos, *at least at this moment*.

## FAQ

### Proper Photo BackUps

Im still in search of my peace of mind regarding backups:

1. Home SSD
2. Home HDD
3. Cloud

The typical **read and write speeds** for different interfaces are as follows:

| Interface | Read Speed (MB/s) | Write Speed (MB/s) |
|---|---|---|
| USB 3.0 | 60 | 30 |
| USB 3.1 Gen 1 | 5 | 5 |
| USB 3.1 Gen 2 | 10 | 10 |
| USB 3.2 Gen 1x1 | 20 | 20 |
| USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 | 40 | 40 |
| USB 4 | 40 | 40 |
| Thunderbolt 4 | 40 | 40 |
| SATA III | 600 | 600 |
| NVMe PCIe 3.0 x4 | 3500 | 3000 |
| NVMe PCIe 4.0 x4 | 7000 | 6000 |

I have been exploring also **NAS** as a reliable options for home backups.

Synlogy seems to be a good alternative, but...in my opinion its just a PC with couple of 3.5 bays.

Im exploring other options at this point.

> I'd just need the space and Linux with containers!


#### Cold Storage
