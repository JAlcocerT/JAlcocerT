To compare these strategies effectively, we need to distinguish between the **Educational/Cohort model** (the first page you shared) and the **Done-For-You (DFY) Agency model** (the second page).

Here is the comparison table to help you decide which approach to use for your analytics offering.

### Strategy Comparison: Educational vs. Service Provider

| Feature | Educational / Cohort Model (AI Agency) | Service / Agency Model (Analytics) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Audience** | Career changers, tech pros, aspiring founders. | Business owners, CMOs, E-com founders. |
| **The "Hook"** | Income Potential ("Make $5-10k/mo"). | Business ROI ("Stop losing ad spend"). |
| **Lead Magnet** | Free Training / Proven Strategy Video. | Free Audit / Strategy Consultation Call. |
| **Primary Value** | **Transformation:** Becoming an agency owner. | **Convenience:** Having the analytics solved. |
| **Barriers (Friction)** | High: User has to do the work themselves. | Low: User pays you to handle the complexity. |
| **Conversion Goal** | Apply for a spot in a class. | Book a sales discovery call. |
| **Proof Required** | Success stories of students/graduates. | Success stories of client revenue growth. |
| **Guarantee Type** | Performance: "Client in 90 days or free." | Result: "Find hidden ROI in 30 days or free." |

### How to choose for your Analytics business:

#### 1. Choose the **Educational Model** if:

* You want to build a community.
* You have a unique "system" for analytics that is easy to teach.
* You want to scale by selling to many people at once (1 to Many).
* **Target:** People who want to *become* marketing analysts.

#### 2. Choose the **Service Agency Model** if:

* You want high-ticket clients (retainers).
* You want to work directly on high-level problems for big brands.
* You have deep technical skills that are hard to teach to beginners.
* **Target:** Companies that need an expert to fix their tracking *today*.

### Key takeaway for Analytics

The **Service Agency Model** is usually the faster path to high revenue in marketing analytics. 

Business owners are often frustrated by the complexity of data (GA4, GTM, Pixel tracking) and would much rather pay an expert to **"make it work"** than learn how to do it themselves.
