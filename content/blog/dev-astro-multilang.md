## Cool Blogging Themes

The Jekyll Chirpy theme is so cool that others have taken it as inspiration.

Which is kind of an improved jekyll theme that i used for the RPi: https://jalcocert.github.io/RPi/

1. [Fuwari](#fuwari)
2. [Frosti](#frosti)
3. HUGO has also something to say: [Hugo Theme Stack](#hugo-theme-stack)

### Fuwari

I wanted to try for long Fuwari Theme:

* https://github.com/saicaca/fuwari

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

This can be combined with PB.
