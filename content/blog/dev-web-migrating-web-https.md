* Initial website `http://englishwithira.pl/`
    * **No https** / SSL certificates ðŸ’¥
    * ~500 ms response time
    * Pretty mediocre speed results as seen by [Google pages Speed](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/http-englishwithira-pl/fxrli277be?form_factor=mobile)

As per [webcheck](https://web-check.xyz/check/http%3A%2F%2Fenglishwithira.pl%2F) the servers are with [ehost](https://ehost.pl/) or [xip](https://www.xip.pl/cennik.php)
* Domain at ~20 usd/y, server from 15 $/y, plus VAT. SSL seems to be extra 10 $/y, making ~50 $/y
* For some reason there was a external link to a totally unrelated site - `https:// koloroweprojekty . pl/` 
* Not only its not secured, but its also harming the planet with a [E Carbon Rating](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/englishwithira-pl/)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mhyfritz/astro-landing-page

npm install
npm run dev
```

Everything worked, so i created this [repo for the project](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/morita-web)


```sh
npm run build
npm install -g serve #serve with npm

serve -s dist #http://localhost:3000
```

## Some Goodies for the Website

1. How to add Calendars

I like to use **Cal.com** (you can also try calendly or [acuityscheduling](https://es.acuityscheduling.com/))

2. Adding Newsletter with MailerLite
