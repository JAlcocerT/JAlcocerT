**Tl;DR**

+++ Using Logto JS SDK with CF Workers (?)




**Intro**

Just recently, I wrote about [Firebase Auth](/JAlcocerT/firebase-auth-101) and the LogTo JS SDK + CF Workers.

A serverless way to authenticate your users.

Why not applying these to a theme: *which kind of reminds me of t3.chat*

> MIT | Minimal web UI for ChatGPT.


And on the recent Audio with AI Post, I was supposed to create a Speech rater with FastAPI that superseeds the streamlit version.

But I got an improvement of my yt audio workflow instead.

The prep work was done anyways: SSG + FastAPI + Audio recording/storing/processing worked.

How about the rating part now?

## FAQ


### Firebase Auth x SSG x CF Workers

Yes, you can combine Firebase Authentication with an Astro static site deployed to Cloudflare Pages to protect certain pages.

However, because Astro in "static" mode builds a purely static site, you cannot use server-side authentication directly on the pages themselves. 

The recommended solution for this is to use **Cloudflare Workers** (or more specifically, **Pages Functions**) to handle the server-side validation.

#### How It Works

This setup requires a mix of client-side and server-side logic:

1.  **Client-Side Authentication:** On the front end, your Astro site's client-side JavaScript uses the Firebase client SDK to handle the user sign-in and sign-up process. When a user successfully signs in, the Firebase client SDK provides an **ID token**. This token is a JSON Web Token (JWT) that proves the user's identity.

2.  **Protecting Static Pages:** The "protection" of a static page is not done at the server level by Cloudflare. Instead, you need to use client-side routing.
    * For a protected page, you check for the presence of a valid ID token.
    * If a token is found, you show the page content.
    * If no token is found, or if the token is invalid, you redirect the user to a sign-in page.

    This is a common approach for static sites, but it's important to understand that the content is still publicly accessible in the site's source code; it's just hidden from unauthorized users via JavaScript.

3.  **Server-Side Validation with Cloudflare Workers (Pages Functions):** For true server-side protection where you need to restrict API calls or dynamic content, you would use **Cloudflare Pages Functions**. When a client makes a request to a serverless function, it sends the user's ID token in the request header.
    * The Pages Function uses the Firebase Admin SDK to **verify the ID token**.
    * If the token is valid, the function can proceed with its logic and return the requested data.
    * If the token is invalid or missing, the function can return an unauthorized (401) or forbidden (403) status code, completely denying access to the content. 

#### The Need for Cloudflare Workers

Yes, you **would need Cloudflare Workers** (or Pages Functions) for any server-side validation or for truly protecting sensitive data.

* **Static sites cannot perform server-side checks.** An Astro static site is a collection of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. It has no server-side process to verify a user's token or to handle authentication logic.

* **Firebase Admin SDK requires a server environment.** The powerful Firebase Admin SDK, which is necessary to verify the authenticity of ID tokens and manage users, can only run in a trusted environment, such as a Cloudflare Worker, a Node.js server, or a Python backend.

It [cannot be used in a web browser](#why-its-a-security-risk), aka CSR.

In summary, for a static site on Cloudflare Pages, Firebase Auth handles the user-facing login flow, while Cloudflare Workers serve as the secure back-end to validate user sessions and provide access to protected data or APIs.

##### Why It's a Security Risk

You can't run the Firebase Admin SDK in a web browser because it's a huge security risk that would allow a malicious user to **tamper with your entire backend**.

The Firebase Admin SDK is designed for **trusted server environments** because it uses a **service account key**. 

This key is not tied to a specific user and has "super-admin" privileges.

It can bypass all of your database security rules, create new users, delete data, and perform any administrative action on your entire project.

If you were to include this key in your client-side code (which is what runs in the user's browser), any user could:

1.  Inspect your website's source code.
2.  Find the service account key.
3.  Use that key to run their own malicious scripts to access or destroy all of your data.

This is why the Admin SDK is only meant to be used on your own servers, like a Cloudflare Worker, a Google Cloud Function, or a Node.js backend. 

> In these environments, the service account key is never exposed to the public.
