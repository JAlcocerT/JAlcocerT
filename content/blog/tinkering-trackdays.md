ELM32 vs ESP32

## Trackday and GoPro MetaData

By the end of last year, a friend got the chance to do this:

{{< youtube "xoOZMAEtqBc" >}}

And it was all recorded with a Go Pro apparently!

So...we can do our [GoPro telemetry trick](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/dji-oa5pro-firmware-updates/#extracting-telemetry-data-from-gph9)

Which basically tells us a lot about **speeds recorded by GoPro GPS** on the 3 video parts which were recorded at 4K30:

You can also open it with **Google Colab**: [![Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JAlcocerT/Py_RouteTracker/blob/main/Z_GoPro/gopro_explore_speeds_TrackDay.ipynb)

**Max Speed**: 41.35 m/s (**148.86 km/h**)
Average Speed: 22.03 m/s (79.30 km/h)
Median Speed: 21.62 m/s (77.84 km/h)

Max Speed: 40.74 m/s (146.65 km/h)
Average Speed: 22.13 m/s (79.66 km/h)
Median Speed: 21.24 m/s (76.46 km/h)

Max Speed: 41.16 m/s (148.18 km/h)
Average Speed: 21.30 m/s (76.68 km/h)
Median Speed: 19.88 m/s (71.57 km/h)

## BMW E36 and Canbus

**Six** in line cilynders of pure joy.

This project ESP32 based and json configurable sounds just amazing:

For the future...maybe a contactless brake temperature system?

We can, with a MLX Sensor!

### What about PhyPhox

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Sometime ago, I was **tinkering with [PhyPhox](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/blog/tinker-phyphox/)**
{{< /callout >}}

And lately...I recorded how it feels (the data behind) an **airplane take-off**:

{{< youtube "Z9xNMP3nW0A" >}}

```sh
ffmpeg -i IMG_5294.MOV -ss 00:03:35 -to 00:05:25 -c copy output.MOV
```

How does it look the data?

You guessed it, you can process PhyPhox Data with Python:

You can also open it with **Google Colab**: [![Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JAlcocerT/Py_RouteTracker/blob/main/Z_GoPro/gopro_explore_speeds_TrackDay.ipynb)
