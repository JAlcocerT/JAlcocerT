It was a very interesting setup.

But I was looking for a way to integrate **CMS with HUGO/Astro**.

* Gitlab provides with [up to 10 GB for repository](https://forum.gitlab.com/t/max-size-per-repo/17403), artifacts and LFS

* Github provides with [Max 5GB per repo](https://www.reddit.com/r/github/comments/xn8y97/is_there_a_limit_to_how_big_a_github_repo_can_be/), with a limit of 100mb per file.

How many cool things can be done with those generous free tiers?
