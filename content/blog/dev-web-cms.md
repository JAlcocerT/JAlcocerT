Lately I have added some [upgrades](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/no-code-ai-tools/#tg-bots) (via [telegram bot](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/EntreAgujayPunto/tree/main/TelegramBot)), so that whenever a customer sends new photos, they are synced to its photo centered repo.

But..wouldnt it be nice to have a native solution?

Some time ago I tried Ghost as CMS connected to Gatsby as **headless CMS**.

It was a very interesting setup.

But I was looking for a way to integrate **a CMS with HUGO/Astro**:

* https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/cms/
* https://jamstack.org/generators/
* https://github.com/postlight/awesome-cms

**Why CMS?**

Because editing [markdown](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/) content or adding [images like so](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/), might not be for everyone.

For me its just fine, but there are many people out there tied to some e2e website providers just because of the *easy UX*, despite the price.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Not sure if its good or bad news, yet there are a ton of CMS and I just needed one of them to be working.

## Why a CMS

## CMS

Content Management Systems (CMS):

- [KEYSTATICCMS](#keystatic-cms)
- [Tina](https://tina.io/)
- [GHOST + GATSBY](https://ghost.org/docs/jamstack/)
- [Strapi](https://jamstack.org/headless-cms/strapi/)
  - Supports **GraphQL** or **RESTful** API.
- [Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS)](https://decapcms.org/)
  - [Add to Your Site](https://decapcms.org/docs/add-to-your-site/)
- [Directus](https://jamstack.org/headless-cms/directus/)
  - Directus turns SQL databases into REST and GraphQL APIs with an intuitive no-code app.


A **file-based CMS** is a content management system that stores its content in files on a server's file system, rather than in a traditional database. These files can be in various formats like Markdown, YAML, JSON, or even plain text.

A **Git-based CMS** is a specific type of file-based CMS that leverages the Git version control system to manage and store content. In this system, the content files are stored in a Git repository. Content editors typically use a user-friendly interface provided by the CMS to make changes, and these changes are then committed to the Git repository. This offers benefits like version control, collaboration features, and the ability to easily roll back changes.

**All Git-based CMS are a subset of file-based CMS.**

* **Foundation in Files:** Git-based CMS inherently rely on storing content as files within a Git repository. This aligns with the fundamental characteristic of a file-based CMS.
* **Git as a File Management Tool:** Git itself is a system designed to track changes to files. A Git-based CMS simply uses Git as its underlying mechanism for managing these content files.

However, **not all file-based CMS are Git-based.** Many file-based CMS exist that manage files directly without using Git for version control. They might use other methods for backup or offer no built-in versioning capabilities at all.

**In summary:** Think of "file-based CMS" as the broader category. Within that category, "Git-based CMS" is a specific type that uses Git for its file management and version control.

### Headless CMS

* https://jamstack.org/headless-cms/
* https://alternateoss.com/category/cms/

A **Headless CMS** (Content Management System) is a type of CMS that **separates the "body" (the backend, where content is created, stored, and managed) from the "head" (the frontend, where content is presented to users)**.

Think of it like this:

* **Traditional CMS (e.g., WordPress, Drupal, Joomla):** These are like a complete car. They come with both the engine (content management and database) and the body (the website's design, themes, templates, and how it looks to users). They're all-in-one solutions that tightly couple content and presentation.

* **Headless CMS:** This is just the engine of the car. It provides a robust system for creating, editing, and storing content, but it **doesn't dictate how or where that content will be displayed**. Instead, it exposes the content through **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)**.

**Key characteristics and what makes it "headless":**

* **Content as a Service (CaaS):** A headless CMS functions primarily as a content repository. It stores content in a structured, raw format (like JSON or XML) and makes it available via APIs.
* **API-First Approach:** The core of a headless CMS is its API. Developers use these APIs to pull the content and then display it on *any* "head" or frontend application.
* **Decoupled Architecture:** The backend and frontend are completely independent. This means you can update or change one without affecting the other.
* **No Built-in Frontend:** Unlike traditional CMS, a headless CMS does not provide themes, templates, or a rendering engine to build the user interface.



**API Based vs GIT Based**

**Remember about these *file hosting* free tiers**

* Gitlab provides with [up to 10 GB for repository](https://forum.gitlab.com/t/max-size-per-repo/17403), artifacts and LFS
* Github provides with [Max 5GB per repo](https://www.reddit.com/r/github/comments/xn8y97/is_there_a_limit_to_how_big_a_github_repo_can_be/), with a limit of 100mb per file.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Keystatic is a ‚Äúfile-based‚Äù CMS and rich-content editor that lives alongside your source code.

* https://keystatic.com/docs/installation-astro

{{< details title="KeyStatic key features üìå" closed="true" >}}

**Core Concepts:**

* **Code-First CMS:**
    * Keystatic is built to integrate tightly with your existing development workflow. It works directly with files in your repository, such as Markdown, YAML, and JSON.
    * This approach allows developers to maintain control over their content structure and versioning.
* **Git-Based:**
    * It leverages Git for content storage and version control. This means your content is stored alongside your code, providing a robust history and collaborative workflow.
* **Headless:**
    * Keystatic is a headless CMS, meaning it focuses on providing **content through an API** rather than dictating how that content is displayed. This allows you to **use your preferred frontend framework** (like Astro, Next.js, or Remix) to build your website or application.
* **Local and Cloud Editing:**
    * It offers flexibility in how you edit content. You can edit content locally during development or use Keystatic Cloud for remote editing, especially when your site is deployed.
* **Content Structuring:**
    * Keystatic allows you to define content schemas, ensuring consistency and organization. This is done through configuration files that define content collections and singletons.
* **User-Friendly Interface:**
    * Despite its code-first approach, Keystatic provides a user-friendly admin UI for content editors, making it accessible to non-technical users.

**Key Advantages:**

* **Developer-Friendly:**
    * Its integration with Git and codebase-centric approach makes it ideal for developers.
* **Version Control:**
    * Git integration provides robust version control and collaboration features.
* **Flexibility:**
    * Headless architecture allows for flexibility in frontend development.
* **Performance:**
    * Working directly with files can lead to fast performance.


{{< /details >}}

**In essence:**

Keystatic is a CMS that bridges the gap between developers and content editors, providing a seamless workflow for managing content within a codebase:

* https://keystatic.com/docs/installation-astro

```sh
npm create @keystatic@latest
```

**What I like about KeyStatic**

It has fully local mode, but also [Github Mode](https://keystatic.com/docs/github-mode)

**How I learnt about KeystaticCMS?**

With 2 astro themes:

1. https://github.com/Boston343/landingpad which I [forked](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/landingpad)

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
Uses [KeyStatic cloud](https://keystatic.com/docs/cloud) to skip some of the GH App config overhead
{{< /callout >}}

2. And due to [Mizar landing Page](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/creating-landing-pages-astro/#conclusions)


{{< callout type="info" >}}
This one is cnfigured to work locally as per its `keystatic.config.ts`. 
{{< /callout >}}



**How I was able to implement it?**

Thanks to [windsurf and some vibecoding](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/vide-coding/#windsurf)!

You will need to do: 

```sh
#npm install keystatic
npm install @keystatic/core @keystatic/astro
```

The `keystatic.config.ts` file is the main configuration file for Keystatic CMS.

```ts
export default config({
	storage: {
		kind: "local",
	},
//........
})
```

It defines how content is managed, structured, and edited within your project.

This file tells Keystatic which collections and singletons to manage, how fields are structured, where content is stored, and how the CMS UI should behave.

This structure shows all the key components we worked with to implement Keystatic:

Configuration Files:
keystatic.config.ts - The main Keystatic configuration
astro.config.mjs - Updated to include Keystatic integration
src/content/config.ts - Content schemas for Astro and Keystatic
Content Directories:
src/content/articles/ - The new directory for articles managed by Keystatic
src/content/docs/ - Existing documentation directories now accessible through Keystatic
Templates:
src/pages/articles/ - Contains templates for displaying articles (index and dynamic [slug] page)
Package Dependencies:
Referenced in package.json (includes @keystatic/core and @keystatic/astro)
This represents the complete file structure relevant to the Keystatic implementation that we set up.

##### KeyStatic Astro Sample

Thanks to [these devs tricks](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/blog/dev-in-docker/)...

I could put [this landing theme](https://github.com/majesticooss/mizar) with **KeyStatic** into selfhosting with my Pi.

1. [Installed Node](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/using-astro-as-website/)

```sh
# Verify installation
node -v   # Should show Node.js version - 20.18.1
npm -v    # Should show npm version - 10.8.2
```

2. Clone the repo and run it, as tested [here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/creating-landing-pages-astro/#faq):

```sh
#git clone https://github.com/majesticooss/mizar
npm install

npm run dev --host #as i was using the Opi
npm run build
#npm install -g serve #serve with npm
#serve -s dist #http://localhost:3000
npx serve -s dist #http://localhost:3000
```

> Go to http://127.0.0.1:4321/

###### KeyStatic CMS with Astro

When you deploy the static site, the `whateverdomain.com/keystatic` path will still be there:

![KeyStatic statically deployed UI](/blog_img/web/staticcms/keystatic-ssg-deployed.png)

>But you wont be able to make any changes, as the server (Typescrypt API) is NOT running.

Now, who are the [real web competitors](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/no-code-websites/#competitors)?

Who are the real people who need one? and their real needs?

Do people *just* want some kind of [linktree alternative](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/linktree-web-alternative/#ssg-solutions-for-linkinbios)?

There is just one way to know: [testing the market](#product-analytics)
