Some time ago I tried Ghost as CMS connected to Gatsby as **headless CMS**.

It was a very interesting setup.

But I was looking for a way to integrate **CMS with HUGO/Astro**:

### Headless CMS

#### API Based

#### GIT Based

* Gitlab provides with [up to 10 GB for repository](https://forum.gitlab.com/t/max-size-per-repo/17403), artifacts and LFS

* Github provides with [Max 5GB per repo](https://www.reddit.com/r/github/comments/xn8y97/is_there_a_limit_to_how_big_a_github_repo_can_be/), with a limit of 100mb per file.

How many cool things can be done with those generous free tiers?

##### KeyStatic CMS

> **MIT** | First class CMS experience, TypeScript API, Markdown & YAML/JSON based, **no DB**

Keystatic CMS is a modern, open-source, headless content management system designed to **work directly with your codebase**. 

{{< details title="KeyStatic key features ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

**Core Concepts:**

* **Code-First CMS:**
    * Keystatic is built to integrate tightly with your existing development workflow. It works directly with files in your repository, such as Markdown, YAML, and JSON.
    * This approach allows developers to maintain control over their content structure and versioning.
* **Git-Based:**
    * It leverages Git for content storage and version control. This means your content is stored alongside your code, providing a robust history and collaborative workflow.
* **Headless:**
    * Keystatic is a headless CMS, meaning it focuses on providing **content through an API** rather than dictating how that content is displayed. This allows you to **use your preferred frontend framework** (like Astro, Next.js, or Remix) to build your website or application.
* **Local and Cloud Editing:**
    * It offers flexibility in how you edit content. You can edit content locally during development or use Keystatic Cloud for remote editing, especially when your site is deployed.
* **Content Structuring:**
    * Keystatic allows you to define content schemas, ensuring consistency and organization. This is done through configuration files that define content collections and singletons.
* **User-Friendly Interface:**
    * Despite its code-first approach, Keystatic provides a user-friendly admin UI for content editors, making it accessible to non-technical users.

**Key Advantages:**

* **Developer-Friendly:**
    * Its integration with Git and codebase-centric approach makes it ideal for developers.
* **Version Control:**
    * Git integration provides robust version control and collaboration features.
* **Flexibility:**
    * Headless architecture allows for flexibility in frontend development.
* **Performance:**
    * Working directly with files can lead to fast performance.

**In essence:**

Keystatic is a CMS that bridges the gap between developers and content editors, providing a seamless workflow for managing content within a codebase:

* https://keystatic.com/docs/installation-astro

```sh
npm create @keystatic@latest
```

**What I like about KeyStatic**

It has fully local mode, but also [Github Mode](https://keystatic.com/docs/github-mode)

**How I learnt about KeystaticCMS?**

* https://github.com/Boston343/landingpad

* And due to [Mizar landing Page](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/creating-landing-pages-astro/)

## Conclusions

### KeyStatic CMS with Astro

When you deploy the static site, the `whateverdomain.com/keystatic` path will still be there:

![KeyStatic statically deployed UI](/blog_img/web/staticcms/keystatic-ssg-deployed.png)

But you wont be able to make any changes, as the server (API) is NOT running.
