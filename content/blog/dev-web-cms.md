Some time ago I tried Ghost as CMS connected to Gatsby as **headless CMS**.

It was a very interesting setup.

But I was looking for a way to integrate **CMS with HUGO/Astro**.

Keystatic CMS is a modern, open-source, headless content management system designed to **work directly with your codebase**. 

{{< details title="KeyStatic key features ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

**Core Concepts:**

* **Code-First CMS:**
    * Keystatic is built to integrate tightly with your existing development workflow. It works directly with files in your repository, such as Markdown, YAML, and JSON.
    * This approach allows developers to maintain control over their content structure and versioning.
* **Git-Based:**
    * It leverages Git for content storage and version control. This means your content is stored alongside your code, providing a robust history and collaborative workflow.
* **Headless:**
    * Keystatic is a headless CMS, meaning it focuses on providing **content through an API** rather than dictating how that content is displayed. This allows you to **use your preferred frontend framework** (like Astro, Next.js, or Remix) to build your website or application.
* **Local and Cloud Editing:**
    * It offers flexibility in how you edit content. You can edit content locally during development or use Keystatic Cloud for remote editing, especially when your site is deployed.
* **Content Structuring:**
    * Keystatic allows you to define content schemas, ensuring consistency and organization. This is done through configuration files that define content collections and singletons.
* **User-Friendly Interface:**
    * Despite its code-first approach, Keystatic provides a user-friendly admin UI for content editors, making it accessible to non-technical users.

**Key Advantages:**

* **Developer-Friendly:**
    * Its integration with Git and codebase-centric approach makes it ideal for developers.
* **Version Control:**
    * Git integration provides robust version control and collaboration features.
* **Flexibility:**
    * Headless architecture allows for flexibility in frontend development.
* **Performance:**
    * Working directly with files can lead to fast performance.

**In essence:**

Keystatic is a CMS that bridges the gap between developers and content editors, providing a seamless workflow for managing content within a codebase

```sh
npm create @keystatic@latest
```

**What I like about KeyStatic**
