Long ago, I was covering [the analytical stack](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/self-taught-career-guide-for-data-analytics/#the-analytical-stack) and the most popular [concepts for a data analytics journey](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/data-basics-for-data-analytics/).

It is time to make a recap.

## Tools


### SQL

You will see it with different names. But **its just [SQL](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/sql-data-analytics)**

TrinoSQL, MySQL,...

Name it as you want it.

Just control the basics and know that there will be some *ad-ons*.

You can now have conversations with a DB via LLMs as described here with LangChain

#### Snowflake

### PySpark

A wrapper in [Python](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/guide-python/) for Spark. [**PySpark**](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/guide-python-PySpark/).

Or Python for the distributed computing/storage era.

This is great for IoT Stuff, like we might have in [Telecom](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/telecom-concepts-101/).

#### DataBricks

{{< callout type="info" >}}
I made a project with a **Raspberry Pi with Mongo&DataBricks** - [here](https://jalcocert.github.io/RPi/posts/rpi-iot-mongodatabricks/)

### DSc Tools

There wont be any good data science work if the data modelling part is not done right.

* ROC - https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/machine-learning-the-roc-curve-in-detail/
* https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/AB-Testing-for-data-analytics/


### T-Shape Tools

**[Diagrams](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/how-to-use-mermaid-diagrams/)**. I should write it in capital letters.

> And you can do [diagrams with AI](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/ai-useful-yet-simple/#diagrams-with-ai)

## Conclusions

Tools are great.

But we need to keep improving the way we use them as well.

[Time Management](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/time-management-data-analytics/) is definitely one of the skills i find most valuable.

Together with [effective meetings](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/effective-meetings-data-analytics/), RACI Matrix & [Project Charter](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-TDSP-ProjectTemplate/blob/master/Docs/Project/Charter.md)
