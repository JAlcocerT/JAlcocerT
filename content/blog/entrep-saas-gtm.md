**TL;DR**

Building around what every business needs: *finding clients*

**Intro**

We are coming from the latest apify / sales / leads related post.

So if you are a pro sales person, you can drop here.

You already know everything and got nothing to learn.

For the rest of you: *here we go*.




[![Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JAlcocerT/leads-slubnechwile/blob/main/apify-101.ipynb)

The question is: can someone like a *Lead Architect* use this to find clients that...need this kind of service?

If this doesnt work, it means that it would be of no value for any 3rd person.

Or that I gave up too quickly :)
