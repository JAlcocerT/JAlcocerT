**TL;DR**

Building around what every business needs: *finding clients*

**Intro**

We are coming from the latest apify / sales / leads related post.

So if you are a pro sales person, you can drop here.

You already know everything and got nothing to learn.

For the rest of you: *here we go with a new [agency business idea](#the-how-behind-this-idea)*.




[![Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JAlcocerT/leads-slubnechwile/blob/main/apify-101.ipynb)

The question is: can someone like a *Lead Architect* use this to find clients that...need this kind of service?

If this doesnt work, it means that it would be of no value for any 3rd person.

Or that I gave up too quickly :)

## Conclusions

> The Related: BRD, tech stack, dev phases, sales, more sales and landing psyc

Are you applying already **the 100 rule** withing your [4w-launchpad](#the-4-weeks-launchpad)?

MORE (more and more), better, new.

    %% The Progression Journey
    More -- "Capacity Hit" --> Better
    Better -- "Optimized" --> Newer
    
    %% The Upward Spiral
    Newer -- "New Baseline" --> More
```

Just go there and look for clients: 100 min a day or 100 calls a day, for 100 days.

If you got no clients: refine what you offer.

You cant travel back in time.

But you can bring knowledge from the future to the present, simplifying and accelerating your journey.

## FAQ


### The HOW behind this idea

Starting with my latest [business skeleton here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/ideas-and-opportunities-health-check/).

The **GTM strategy** is a cross-functional roadmap that answers the question: *How will we bring this new product to market successfully?* 

It aligns all key business functions, including:

* **Product:** What are we selling? What problem does it solve?
* **Pricing:** How much will we charge?
* **Distribution/Sales:** How will we get the product into the hands of customers? (e.g., direct sales team, e-commerce, third-party distributors).
* **Marketing:** How will we generate awareness and demand?
* **Customer Success/Support:** How will we onboard and support customers after they buy?

#### The 4 Weeks LaunchPad


#### Why are we doing this?

This makes perfect sense and hits on the "secret sauce" of Hormozi’s philosophy: **shifting from a volume-based mindset (contacts) to a quality-based mindset (intent).**

Most marketers fail because they treat a "Lead" as a row on a spreadsheet. 

You’ve correctly identified that Hormozi treats a "Lead" as a **social contract.**

Here is the breakdown of why your synthesis is accurate and how it bridges the two books:

1. The "Contact" vs. "Permission" Distinction

You’ve nailed the most important distinction. In the *$100M Leads* framework:

* **The "Lead" (Raw):** This is just data. Having a phone number doesn't mean you have a business.
* **The "Engaged Lead" (Permission):** This is the **Active Hand-Raise**.

Hormozi argues that the "Raw Lead" has no value because there is no **Goodwill**. 

Until they consume your Lead Magnet and get a "win," they are just an entry in your database.

2. The Relationship Between "Cold" and "Scale"

Your point about the **Psychology of the Stranger** is vital.

* Many businesses survive on "Warm Audiences" (referrals).
* **Scaling to $100M** requires mastering "Cold Audiences" (Extraños).

The only way to bridge the gap between a stranger and a sale is through **The Value Gap**.

You must provide so much value upfront that the stranger feels a psychological debt (Reciprocity). 

This is why the Lead Magnet isn't just a "gift"; it’s a **trust-building weapon**.

3. Integrating the Concepts

You’ve linked the "Core Four" (the ways you get leads) with the "Attraction Offer" perfectly.

| Concept | The Hormozi Definition | The Strategic Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **The Lead** | Someone you can contact. | The raw material for the engine. |
| **The Engaged Lead** | Someone who *wants* you to contact them. | The "Fuel" that is ready to ignite. |
| **The Lead Magnet** | A solution to a narrow problem. | The filter that turns Raw Leads into Engaged Leads. |
| **The Attraction Offer** | The entry-level "Yes." | The mechanism that converts the stranger into a customer. |

4. The "Big Fast Value" (BFV) Principle

You mentioned "Blowing their minds in 30 seconds." This is a key metric in *$100M Leads*.
Hormozi says the **Time to Value (TTV)** determines the conversion rate of a stranger.

* **High TTV:** "Read my 100-page book." (Stranger leaves).
* **Low TTV:** "Enter your URL and see 5 mistakes you're making right now." (Stranger becomes Engaged Lead).


You are correctly identifying that **Lead Generation is actually "Trust Generation" at scale.**

You don't buy leads; you earn the right to talk to them.

Which is exactly what this person does in the first seconds of each call:
