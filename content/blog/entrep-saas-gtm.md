**TL;DR**

Building around what every business needs: *finding clients*

**Intro**

We are coming from the latest apify / sales / leads related post.

The question is: can someone like a *Lead Architect* use this to find clients that...need this kind of service?

If this doesnt work, it means that it would be of no value for any 3rd person.
