## Choosing a Printer

People recommended me: Prusa or BambuLabs

## Where to get 3DPrint Designs

## Software for DYI Designs

* I made some notes on [how to install some design programs](https://jalcocert.github.io/Linux/docs/debian/foss_engineering):
    * GIMP
    * Blender
    * FreeCad
    * OpenSCad
    * https://github.com/nkallen/plasticity?tab=readme-ov-file

## My 3D Printing Plans

Can't wait to make some mechanism design and see it work.

* There is an **awsome project by Gabemorris12** - https://github.com/gabemorris12/mechanism
    * ...which I forked and have pending to [give it a serious trial](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/mechanism)
* Most likely I will start with [a simple, yet useful Slider-Crank](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Slider-Crank)

> If you like mechanism, you can have a look at my [Bicycle Dynamics Simulator](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Bike_dynamic_simulator)

## FAQ

### Designs as Code

1. **GIMP with python** - https://docs.gimp.org/2.10/en_GB/gimp-filters-python-fu.html

Before we start writing Python scripts in GIMP, we need to install the Python-Fu plug-in. This plug-in enables GIMP to run Python scripts.

2. **FreeCAD with Python** - https://wiki.freecad.org/Python_scripting_tutorial
    * Query2CAD: [Generating CAD models using natural language queries](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.00144v1)
