## FAQ

### Designs as Code

1. **GIMP with python** - https://docs.gimp.org/2.10/en_GB/gimp-filters-python-fu.html

Before we start writing Python scripts in GIMP, we need to install the Python-Fu plug-in. This plug-in enables GIMP to run Python scripts.

2. **FreeCAD with Python** - https://wiki.freecad.org/Python_scripting_tutorial
