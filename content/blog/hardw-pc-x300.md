It is about **time to put everything together**.

This year I got this **compact ~2L box** as my new personal computer (probably server at some point).

Why a server?

I went crazy and build it with **64GB RAM**.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
* Processing power for my new YT Video creation: [Dji OA5Pro](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/dji-osmo-action-5-pro/) & [Pixel 8Pro](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/pixel-8-pro-tricks/) +++ [Video edition with ffmpeg](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/YT-Video-Edition) and [video with remotion](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/VideoEditingRemotion)
* Companion for the [SBC's](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/cloud-vs-single-board-computers), and the [ThinkPad](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/laptop-lenovo-thinkpad-x13-benchmark/)
{{< /callout >}}

The idle consumptions of the x300 are decent (12/13w with 2 ssd's) and max power drawn during the tests of 53W.

With a room air temperature of 21C, in idle the air was getting out of the computer at ~28C:

![x300 air temperature](/blog_img/hardware/asrockx300-air-temp.jpg)

Those **W are heating the air** as it passes to ~+7C when in ~idle

{{< details title="How is that heating going? 📌" closed="true" >}}

1. **Smaller Airflow:**
   * Original airflow: 50 m³/h
   * New airflow: 50 m³/h / 6 = 8.33 m³/h

2. **Convert to Mass Flow Rate:**
   * Convert to m³/s: 8.33 m³/h / 3600 s/h = 0.002314 m³/s
   * Mass flow rate of dry air: 0.002314 m³/s * 1.2 kg/m³ = 0.002777 kg/s

3. **Mass Flow Rate of Water Vapor (using the same humidity ratio of 0.01):**
    * Mass flow rate of water vapor: 0.002777 kg/s * 0.01 = 0.00002777 kg/s

4. **Specific Heat Capacities (same as before):**
   * Dry air: 1006 J/kg°C
   * Water vapor: 1840 J/kg°C

5. **Power Calculation:**

   * **Power to heat dry air:**
      * Power = 0.002777 kg/s * 1006 J/kg°C * 7°C = 19.5 W

   * **Power to heat water vapor:**
      * Power = 0.00002777 kg/s * 1840 J/kg°C * 7°C = 0.36 W

   * **Total Power:**
      * Total Power = 19.5 W + 0.36 W = 19.86 W

**Therefore, the heat dissipation is approximately 20 watts.**

Let's break down the full KaTeX formula for calculating the heat dissipation, step by step.

**Variables:**

*   `Q`: Heat dissipation (power) in watts (W)
*   `ṁ_a`: Mass flow rate of dry air in kilograms per second (kg/s)
*   `c_a`: Specific heat capacity of dry air, approximately 1006 J/kg°C
*   `ṁ_w`: Mass flow rate of water vapor in kilograms per second (kg/s)
*   `c_w`: Specific heat capacity of water vapor, approximately 1840 J/kg°C
*   `ΔT`: Change in temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)
*   `V`: Volumetric airflow rate in cubic meters per second (m³/s)
*   `ρ_a`: Density of air, approximately 1.2 kg/m³
*   `h`: Humidity ratio (kg of water vapor per kg of dry air)
    
{{< /details >}}


ṁ_a = V \times ρ_a
ṁ_w = ṁ_a \times h
Q_a = ṁ_a \times c_a \times ΔT
Q_w = ṁ_w \times c_w \times ΔT
Q = Q_a + Q_w
Q = (V \times ρ_a \times c_a \times ΔT) + ((V \times ρ_a \times h) \times c_w \times ΔT)

Q = V \times ρ_a \times ΔT \times (c_a + h \times c_w)

$$
Q = 0.0139 \times 1.2 \times 7 \times (1006 + 0.01 \times 1840) \approx 120 \, \text{W} 
$$


## Asrock x300 How to

Im using **Ubuntu KDE Plasma** with Kernel 6.8. Customized [like so](https://jalcocert.github.io/Linux/docs/debian/conky_configuring_ubuntu/#how-to-tweak-kde-plasma).



{{< details title="Screen/Display Setup in Linux 📌" closed="true" >}}

I am using a Flatron W1946, which it is native 1360x768 and it was not detected by default.

```sh
#xrandr --query #get the name, in this case, DisplayPort-1
cvt 1360 768 60
xrandr --newmode "1360x768_60.00" 85.25  1360 1424 1568 1776  768 771 778 795 -hsync +vsync
xrandr --addmode DisplayPort-1 "1360x768_60.00"
xrandr --output DisplayPort-1 --mode "1360x768_60.00"
```

And now, I could see the configuration also in the System Settings UI, right at Display Configuration.

{{% details title="Asrock X300 Wifi Connectivity 📌" closed="true" %}}

Using an **TP-Link Archer T3U (AC1300)**, which I upgraded to the **AC1300 T4U Plus** version.

* The AC1300 is a dualband usb adapter (5ghz up to 867Mbps and 400Mbps on 2.4)


```sh
ip addr show
hostname -I

#sudo apt-get install net-tools
#ifconfig
#ifconfig eth0 | grep -A 10 "<global>" #check mac, and transfered packages
ifconfig eth0 | grep "inet " | awk '{ print $2 }' #if ETH Connected - SEE THE LOCAL IP
#ifconfig tailscale0 | grep "inet " | awk '{ print $2 }' #for Tailscale

ping -c 4 192.168.0.1 #gateway
ping -c 4 192.168.0.117 #ping the orange pi which is connected to same device
ping 9.9.9.9 #ping quad9 dns server
```

```sh
sudo apt-get install dnsutils -y #dns resolution
nslookup github.com 
dig google.com
```

```sh
sudo apt-get install speedtest-cli
speedtest-cli #speedtest-cli --simple

sudo snap install fast
fast
#npm install --global fast-cli && fast
```

* The Opi5 with cable has 780/60 for comparison.

> Got 195mb/s and 58mb/s with the T3U and **218/59 with the t4U Plus**.

* Regular browser speed test: https://www.speedtest.pl/

I like to use **QUAD9 DNS's**:

```sh
sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
```

Add the following, if you want, to use **quad9 DNS**:

```sh
#nameserver 192.168.0.117 #to use the OPi5 locally
nameserver 9.9.9.9
nameserver 149.112.112.112
```

```sh
nslookup google.com #see that now you are using quad9 DNS
```

### Server Power and Fan Management

As per [this post](https://askubuntu.com/questions/22108/how-to-control-fan-speed)

But I decided to manage everything via the **BIOS**.

So now the fan is at 30% up to 60 Celsius.

> For Windows you can use [**FanControl**](https://github.com/Rem0o/FanControl.Releases) or AMD Adrenaline Software.

> You also have `thinkfan` for [Thinkpads](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/laptop-lenovo-thinkpad-x13-benchmark/)

## Conclusions of Asrock X300

* https://github.com/masonr/yet-another-bench-script

{{< details title="Benchmarks of Asrock x300 with Ryzen 5600G 📌" closed="true" >}}

Released on Jan 2021, with 7nm, its related GPU has 8 ROPs and 28 TMUs as per GPU-Z from TechPowerUp Software.


{{< /details >}}

> The X300 supports **2.5-inch** drives with a thickness of **7mm or 9.5mm** (which normally go up to 2TB).

The energy consumption is reasonable, at **~15w with Linux**, Windows goes ++66%:

### What am I using it for right now?


#### Video Editing 101

I recently started to make some simple video edits.

Video editing [with shell scripts](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/YT-Video-Edition/tree/main/With_FFmpeg) was interesting.

But I needed to try [Python video editing with moviePy](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/YT-Video-Edition/tree/main/With_Python).

And it can do crazy stuff.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
[Video Edition Repo](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/YT-Video). Using **[ffmpeg](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/YT-Video-Edition/tree/main/With_FFmpeg)**. Or using [**Python MoviePy**](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/YT-Video-Edition/tree/main/With_Python) which worked for Windows/Linux
{{< /callout >}}

Like having **speech recognition** and silencing the parts with human voices...

...so that only the music is playing at those moments.

#### AI Stuff

* Generating Content - [like so](<https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Scrap_Tools/tree/main/FireCrawl/Z_Scrap_GHRepo)>)
    * Already working for interesting sites, like [this](https://gitlab.com/fossengineer1/fossengineerpapermod)
* [Better CVs](https://gitlab.com/fossengineer1/cv-check) for all with [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/usage)
    * [MailerLite API to check emails](https://gitlab.com/fossengineer1/cv-check/-/blob/main/Z_Tests/MailerLite/test_mailerlite_v1.py?ref_type=heads), makes it easy to place a [small wall to streamlit](https://gitlab.com/fossengineer1/cv-check/-/blob/main/Z_CVCheck_pdfmineropenAI_v2b.py?ref_type=heads)
        * If you choose doble opt-in, they will verify the email
    * But we could also use [FormBricks](https://gitlab.com/fossengineer1/cv-check/-/tree/main/Z_Tests/FormBricks?ref_type=heads) as a wall
        * You can get feedback on the users needs before/after trying the app
        * If you connect the form with GSheets and make python read it, you have a simple way to compare emails for access
        * Forms can be embed on email, on website (as iframe or pop up) and...with a simple link.
    * Or...a real paywall, with [StripeAPI](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apps)
        * It allow to have [pricing tables](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/pricing-tables/create), to embed on your website with a async scrypt that you can copy paste
        * Stripe API is crazy cool - YOu can get info about sessions, customers (which product/ subscription have they bought, if its on trial, active...)
    * Keeping the [prompts tidy & consistent](https://gitlab.com/fossengineer1/cv-check/-/tree/main/Prompts?ref_type=heads)
    * And Streamlit can be customized in cool ways with option menu and [bootstrap icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)
    * And improvement the way I build my [docker-compose with API keys](https://gitlab.com/fossengineer1/cv-check/-/blob/main/Z_DeployMe/Docker-Compose.yml?ref_type=heads)
    * Oh, and even [gitlab CI/CD](https://gitlab.com/fossengineer1/cv-check/-/blob/main/.gitlab-ci.yml?ref_type=heads) testing!
        * You can see their status at the [jobs tab](https://gitlab.com/fossengineer1/cv-check/-/jobs)
    * Better [sqlite logs to see](https://gitlab.com/fossengineer1/cv-check/-/blob/main/Consolidate_logins.py?ref_type=heads) who actually uses it

### What happened with the Bmax B4?

I decided to give it to a friend.

Reason being that I wanted an upgrade in computing power from my previous Desktop with a 2200G.

This provides a comprehensive view of all the devices' performance and specifications in one table.

## Desktop with VPS as VPN with Wireguard

Time to combine a Desktop, like the X300 + [Hetzner](https://jalcocert.github.io/Linux/docs/linux__cloud/cloud/#other-clouds) to get a **custom VPN connection** with Wireguard.

> Use the [Hetzner Setup Script](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Linux/blob/main/Z_Cloud/Hetzner_101.sh) or the[ **SelfHosting Script**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JAlcocerT/Linux/main/Z_Linux_Installations_101/Selfhosting_101.sh) as described [here](https://jalcocert.github.io/Linux/docs/linux__cloud/selfhosting/)

{{% steps %}}

### Server Setup

I am spinning a [Hetzner (Cloud) Server](https://jalcocert.github.io/Linux/docs/linux__cloud/cloud/#hetzner). Like the one Benchmarked on [this post](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/cloud-vs-single-board-computers/).

Then, with this [Wireguard Server DockerCompose](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Docker/blob/main/Security/VPNs/Wireguard_docker_compose.yaml)...


{{< details title="Connect via SSH & Setup WireGuard📌" closed="true" >}}

```sh
ssh root@serverip #or use a terminal via
```


Lets do it with [wgeasy](https://github.com/wg-easy/wg-easy), or if you prefer with plane [WireGuard](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Docker/blob/main/Security/VPNs/Wireguard_docker_compose.yaml)

```sh
#create the hashed PWD
docker run --rm -it ghcr.io/wg-easy/wg-easy wgpw 'YOUR_PASSWORD'

docker run --rm -it ghcr.io/wg-easy/wg-easy wgpw 'YOUR_PASSWORD' | sed 's/\$/\$\$/g'
```

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
* Don't wrap the generated hash password in single quotes when you use docker-compose.yml. Instead, replace each $ symbol with two $$ symbols. [Example](https://github.com/wg-easy/wg-easy/blob/master/How_to_generate_an_bcrypt_hash.md)

* You'll get different results (for the same given pass) because the hash is salted

### Wireguard Setup


{{< details title="Check that the Wireguard Connection works 📌" closed="true" >}}


{{< /details >}}


### Connecting the Wireguard Client

Setup a regular Wireguard Client in Windows / Linux.

Also on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wireguard.android&hl=en-US).

Or use [Gluetun as Client with Docker](https://fossengineer.com/using-bard-selfhosting-firefox-with-vpn-and-docker/#vpn---via-docker-gluetun):

* https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun-wiki/blob/main/setup/wireguard.md
* https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun-wiki/blob/main/setup/providers/custom.md

Gluetun help us connects to some VPN providers when we cant install the official client.

{{< /details >}}

### [Optional] - Setup Wifi2ETH Bridge

You can do this steps with a Raspberry Pi (connected to WIFI) as Wireguard  client.

Which will then provide VPN access to your desktop via the Ethernet cable.

Up til now, I was very happy with my Ryzen 2200G, 16GB RAM DDR4.

The MB was a B450M S2H, that potentially can also accept this new 5600G and with NVMe PCIe Gen3 x4 m.2 2280 (the first one I tried!)

And as per the tower, a [Aerocool CS-105](https://aerocool.io/product/cs-105/): microATX or miniITX
with support for up to 320cm GPUs.

The Thermaltake Litepower 450W behaved properly with a RX580 back en the days (even allowed tinkering with crypto mining!)
