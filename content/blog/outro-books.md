## sell yourself

A successful brand combines three actions: intentional creation, consistent delivery and selling yourself to the public. However, you have to know what kind of brand you want to embody before you sell anything.
“Do you know what you want and where you want to be?”

You probably have many positive, sellable attributes that could work as a brand. Start with narrowing down those traits and interests to the ones that matter most and choosing a single message. If you try to sell two seemingly disconnected brands at once, such as a computer salesman who also has a personal fitness side hustle, you will end up sending mixed messages and dilute your brand’s power.

Instead, look for ways to incorporate all the parts of your multifaceted persona, so that they **enhance each other** rather than clash against each other. 

This reminded me of the *skill transfer* effect - basically our abilities that we have learned in one aparentlly non connected area of our life, are applied to contexts that are different from the one in which they were originally learned.

For example, if you like fitness but also want to run a consulting firm, brand yourself not by what you do, but by who you are. Use your top traits such as hardworking, curious or dedicated to define your brand.

## Create a blueprint for your brand.

If you leave your brand to chance, you let others define your image, which can severely reduce your chances of getting the job, success or lifestyle that you want. Carefully shaping your brand, and defining how you present yourself in every type of situation, puts control back in your corner.

“Every good salesperson understands that you have to know your product inside and out and make a plan to sell every aspect of it.”
To build an effective brand, you must have a plan. You need a blueprint that is thoroughly researched and honestly reflects your capabilities. To start, follow these four steps:

* Pinpoint how you see yourself – Do you see certain aspects of yourself, such as your religion, race or gender, as important to your identity? Which core values, such as honesty, resonate with you?
* Identify how you want your life to look – What are your goals? Do you want to have kids, create a business or invent the next big thing?
* Consider what you don’t want – Sometimes your dreams don’t match your reality. You may want to be a poet, but if you hate public speaking, it won’t work. Think about the things you don’t like doing and how they might affect your brand.
* Focus on what you want – Nobody is good at everything. Pick what’s important to you and what you can do well, and focus solely on those things.
* Your brand should also reflect what’s unique about you. Ask others what traits they think of when you come to mind. These qualities help differentiate you from the competition and provide authenticity to your brand. For instance, if people already think of you as an extrovert, branding yourself as a people person will come easily, because it’s already a natural fit.

Remember, your brand needs to last a long time, so whatever you pick needs to be sustainable. While changing brands isn’t impossible, like Vera Wang who went from a figure skater to fashion designer, it does mean starting over from scratch. So, choose wisely.


## Sell your brand in five steps

If you want to sell your brand successfully, then you need to plan like a professional. That means taking an overview of the territory into which you will introduce your brand and creating a map to where you want to go. Like any top salesperson, follow these five steps for success:

* “Plan for the sale” – Get an overall look at the steps you will need to take. What are your top selling points? To whom would they appeal? Where can you find those people? How will you make them notice or remember you?
* “Look for opportunities to sell your brand” – Start talking to people about your brand, your goals and where you want to go. Like planting seeds, the more people you talk to, the more your brand will circulate. Before you know it, those seeds will grow into opportunities.
* “Establish trust with the people you want to buy your brand” – Be consistent with your brand. Build trust through reliability.
* “Ask for what you want” – Your hard work is great, but it won’t speak for you. You need to advocate for yourself and tell others what you want. Don’t be “too proud to accept help.” You need others’ referrals to build credibility and their support to make your life easier.
* “Follow up with consistency and gratitude” – If somebody helps you grow, or lands you a great job, thank them. Don’t just use words; make sure you deliver on your brand’s promises. -->

## Story Tell

<!-- 
Data storytelling in analytics is important because it helps to uncover insights from data that might otherwise go unnoticed, and also helps to communicate those insights to others in a more engaging and memorable way. By presenting data in the form of a narrative, we can make the insights more relatable and understandable to a wider range of people. This is especially important in the world of business, where decisions need to be made based on data and insights, but not everyone may have the technical expertise to fully understand the underlying data.

Furthermore, data storytelling has been shown to be more effective at communicating insights and influencing decisions than simply presenting data in a spreadsheet or chart. By providing context and meaning to the data, data storytelling can help decision-makers better understand the implications of the data and make more informed decisions based on those insights. Overall, data storytelling is a powerful tool that can help organizations unlock the full potential of their data and use it to drive better decision-making and business outcomes. -->

story telling with data -->

<!-- In your analytics career,

<!-- Data interacts with narratives and systems in the following ways:
* Data shapes a strategic narrative – Whether you’re segmenting customers or developing brand stories, data provides context to shape and share stories.
* Data visualizations deliver the story – In formats such as data journalism, data-inspired social media campaigns and analyst reports, organizations use data visualizations to deliver powerful stories.
* Data provides macro insights – Humans or AI interpret big-picture patterns in data to form an insight, which provides the basis for a story.
* Data shapes processes – Using visually prepared data – via dashboards – systems emerge that enable the control of workflows, processes and states by detecting anomalies and monitoring systems. -->


<!-- ### The Echo Chambers

When society embraces disruptive new scientific theories, philosopher Thomas Kuhn explains that such changes demand a “paradigm shift”: People must debate and agree upon a new narrative before replacing the old one. Today, however, people often only engage with those who share their opinions. Digital channels have returned humans to a cave-like existence: Only a small social bubble within an echo chamber shares a given person’s view of reality.

“The multiplicity of digital channels allows us to avoid self-awareness and surround ourselves with the people (or machines, it is not always certain) who share our opinions.” 

Individuals that hold opposing viewpoints on reality encourage, criticize, and adjust one another's ideas, influencing economic and human behavior. Different narratives, like an epidemic, may infect and alter communities, according to Shiller. The validity of a narrative has no bearing on its "contagion rate." Viral tales capture attention, look cohesive, and fit readily into existing narratives.
