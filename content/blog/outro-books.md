<!-- ### The Echo Chambers

When society embraces disruptive new scientific theories, philosopher Thomas Kuhn explains that such changes demand a “paradigm shift”: People must debate and agree upon a new narrative before replacing the old one. Today, however, people often only engage with those who share their opinions. Digital channels have returned humans to a cave-like existence: Only a small social bubble within an echo chamber shares a given person’s view of reality.

“The multiplicity of digital channels allows us to avoid self-awareness and surround ourselves with the people (or machines, it is not always certain) who share our opinions.” 

Individuals that hold opposing viewpoints on reality encourage, criticize, and adjust one another's ideas, influencing economic and human behavior. Different narratives, like an epidemic, may infect and alter communities, according to Shiller. The validity of a narrative has no bearing on its "contagion rate." Viral tales capture attention, look cohesive, and fit readily into existing narratives.
