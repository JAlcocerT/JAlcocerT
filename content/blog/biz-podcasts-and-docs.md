**What I like about this Starlight theme?**

1. Doc like interface
2. Internationalization (different languages with `i18n`)
3. Search built in (with algoliasearch)
4. Amazing Docs: https://starlight.astro.build/

```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template starlight
npm run dev
```

**Whats missing (imo)?**

1. Blog Interface

## Conclusions

### A look to GitPodcast

I was (one more time) amazed on what people is able to create:

* https://github.com/BandarLabs/gitpodcast

> MIT | Convert any git repository into an engaging podcast

Does this resonates with creating **AI powered podcasts** on how selfhosting projects work?

**How does this works?**

Its crazy how it summarizes the streamlit repo...

See it yourself: https://www.gitpodcast.com/streamlit/streamlit
