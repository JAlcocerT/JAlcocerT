As [commented earlier this year](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/how-to-chat-with-pdfs/), I was inspired by **Alejandro AO** and its **Python AI projects**.


[I commented the PDF one **here** â†’](/JAlcocerT/how-to-chat-with-pdfs)

But today, it is the **time for [CSV's](#chat-with-csv-with-langchain)** and with **[Databases](#chat-with-a-db-with-langchain)**!

You guessed it.

We will be using **LangChain** as RAG framework to provide the **CSV context to the LLM**.

[LangChain is an alternative](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/how-to-use-pandasAI/#other-foss-ways-to-chat-with-your-data) to [PandasAI](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/how-to-use-pandasAI/).


{{< callout type="info" >}}
I am creating a public repo with all sort if interesting RAG libraries to **[Chat over Data](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Data-Chat)** ðŸ’» 
{{< /callout >}}

## Chat with CSV with LangChain

You will need to have:

* [Python installed](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/guide-python/#installing-python-) and a [virtual environment](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/useful-python-stuff/) ready.
* The OpenAI API keys - https://platform.openai.com/api-keys


{{< callout type="info" >}}
See the modified working code [here](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/langchain-ask-csv) ðŸ’»
{{< /callout >}}

These are the libraries you will need:

```sh
pip install langchain python-dotenv streamlit openai
```

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
But that way will install the latest version of each.
{{< /callout >}}



Which may cause incompatibilities in the future.

Thats why the original Alejandro AO Project has the `requirements.txt` file specifying the version.

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
#pip install langchain==0.0.208 python-dotenv==1.0.0 streamlit==1.25.0 openai==0.27.0 transformers==4.28.1 sentence_transformers==2.2.2 torch==2.0.1 tensorflow==2.12.0
```

I just removed most of them as the original file seemed to have many more than required.

Remember to place your OpenAI API key in the `.env` file.

And run the Streamlit App:

```sh
streamlit run main.py
```

### Understanding CSV with LangChain App

This is the general workflow of the Python app:


```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Load environment variables with dotenv] --> B{Check if OPENAI_API_KEY is set?}
    B -- No --> C[Exit program]
    B -- Yes --> D[Set Streamlit page config and header]
    D --> E[User uploads CSV file]
    E --> F{CSV file uploaded?}
    F -- No --> G[Wait for CSV upload]
    F -- Yes --> H[Create CSV agent using Langchain and OpenAI]
    H --> I[User inputs question]
    I --> J{Is a question provided?}
    J -- No --> K[Wait for question]
    J -- Yes --> L[Process the question with agent]
    L --> M[Display result using Streamlit]
```

## Chat with a DB with LangChain

It's not that SQL is impossible to learn.

But why not using AI as leverage to help us with D&A tasks?

And it is possible thanks to LangChain with [Python](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/useful-python-stuff/) and the great work of AlejandroAO

{{< callout type="info" >}}
One more time, thanks to AlejandroAO this have been possible. The working code is on my [data-chat repo](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/langchain-ask-csv) ðŸ’» as it was not provided an original one.

{{< details title="Useful Tools for DBs ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

* [ChartDB](https://github.com/chartdb/chartdb) - Database diagrams editor that allows you to visualize and design your DB with a single query.
* [SQLiteViz](https://github.com/lana-k/sqliteviz)
* [SQliteBrowser](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser)

You can see that the **DB is loaded** and we can see its **Schema**.

Actually, we can make already a **MermaidJS ER diagram** to represent it:

```mermaid

    Album {
        int AlbumId PK
        varchar Title
        int ArtistId FK
    }

        varchar Name
    }
    Customer {
        int CustomerId PK
