**Tl;DR**



**Intro**

This year I have been consolidating some IoT/Sensor and MQTT knowledge on few posts:

Then, I found out about:

* https://streamr.network/
    * https://streamr.network/hub/projects
* https://docs.streamr.network/

> The Decentralized Data Network

> > Streamr is a next-gen communication network, featuring serverless data streaming and media broadcasts that scale automatically.

## Streamr Project

The Streamr Network: decentralized real‑time data

The decentralized P2P real-time data pub/sub network.

Build Web3 projects that leverage the Streamr data crowdsourcing and monetization infrastructure.

Example: https://streamr.network/hub/projects/0xbeb773584fb72bb8fa138844fc4a86a6573a511f11bd22cfae387e9406444690/overview

## Pub Sub Network Architecture

It decouples publisher from subscribers.

A publisher can be anyone or anything that provides a message.

## Conclusions

A friend also mentioned to me about [acurast](https://acurast.com/developers/).

Which is supposed to be a decentralized compute network.

I didnt see any OSS project for it, so...im quite skeptical.

## FAQ

Web3 is not the dark web
