**Tl;DR**



**Intro**

This year I have been consolidating some IoT/Sensor and MQTT knowledge on few posts:

Then, a friend told me about:

## Streamr Project

The Streamr Network: decentralized real‑time data

The decentralized P2P real-time data pub/sub network.

Build Web3 projects that leverage the Streamr data crowdsourcing and monetization infrastructure.

Example: https://streamr.network/hub/projects/0xbeb773584fb72bb8fa138844fc4a86a6573a511f11bd22cfae387e9406444690/overview

## Pub Sub Network Architecture

It decouples publisher from subscribers.

A publisher can be anyone or anything that provides a message.

## Conclusions

A friend also mentioned to me about [acurast](https://acurast.com/developers/).

Which is supposed to be a decentralized compute network.

I didnt see any OSS project for it, so...im quite skeptical.

## FAQ

[Web3](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/guide-web3/) is not the dark web.

But in theory, you can also publish your website there as well

### Shodan


<!-- shodan related to internet of the things

Shodan is a specialized search engine that allows users to find Internet-connected devices. Unlike traditional search engines that index websites and pages, Shodan collects information about network-connected devices such as servers, security cameras, routers, printers, and IoT (Internet of Things) devices1. Here are some key points about Shodan:

Search Engine for Internet-Connected Devices: Shodan is often referred to as the “world’s first search engine for Internet of Things (IoT) devices.” It provides a way to discover various types of servers, webcams, routers, and other devices connected to the Internet. -->

<!-- SHODAN

Search engine similar to Google
What Is Shodan? Shodan is a search engine similar to Google. But while Google searches for websites, Shodan searches for devices that are connected to the internet. Users can perform a search using the Shodan search engine based on an IP address, device name, city, and/or a variety of other technical categories.
