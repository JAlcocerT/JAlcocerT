## No Code

## Marketing

If you are doing ads and getting users to register into your app

Or have made a sales pipeline

Or...are just looking for high value prospects in a lead db like `https://www.storecensus.com/pricing` for your killer idea.

You will need these tools.

And im not just thinking about a Lean DRIP automatic email.

But these selfhosting ones.
