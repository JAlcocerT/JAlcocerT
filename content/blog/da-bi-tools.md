For the IoT Fans out there: Grafana, Kibana and Chronogaph

#### Grafana

There are many Grafana stacks, like LGTM: **L**oki, **G**rafana, **T**empo and Pro**m**etheus

{{< details title="What can I do with LGTM? ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

Ever wondered how programmers build software? If builders built houses the way programmers build software, the first woodpecker to come along would destroy civilization.

In this video, Fireship, a popular YouTube creator, takes us on a journey to instrument, collect, and visualize telemetry data from our server using open telemetry and the **LGTM stack**.


The **LGTM stack** consists of five technologies: 
- **Open Telemetry**: An industry-standard framework that collects telemetry data from software.
- **Grafana**: The frontend UI for visualizing data.
- **Prometheus**: A time-series database for storing metrics.
- **Tempo**: A database for storing traces.
- **Loki**: A database for storing logs.

Setting Up the LGTM Stack

To get started:
1. **Server Setup**: Fireship recommends using Hostinger, which offers a variety of hosting services, including a Linux virtual private server (VPS) suitable for this project.
2. **Deploying LGTM Backend**: The LGTM backend can be deployed using a Docker image provided by Graphon.
3. **Server Access**: After setting up your server on Hostinger, you can access the management dashboard and connect via SSH.

Running Grafana

1. **Verify Docker**: Use a Docker command to confirm the Docker daemon is running.
2. **Run Docker Image**: Pull the Docker image for OTel LGTM from the cloud, which may take a minute.
3. **Access Grafana**: Open the browser and navigate to the IP address on port 3000 to log into Grafana as admin.

Connecting to a Data Source

Grafana alone is not useful unless connected to a data source. Fireship demonstrates how to connect **Loki**, **Prometheus**, and **Tempo**, and then populate them with data using a sample application built with **Dino**, a framework with built-in telemetry support.

Analyzing Data with Grafana

With the LGTM stack up and running:
- Use Grafana to explore logs, metrics, and traces.
- Use **Prometheus' query language** to analyze and dive deeper into your data to identify errors and anomalies.

Takeaways

- The **LGTM stack** provides a holistic approach to software observability, enabling you to instrument, collect, and visualize telemetry data from your server.
- With the right tools, you can identify errors and anomalies in your application, allowing for data-driven decisions to improve your software.
- **Security** is crucial when deploying a telemetry backend. Services like Hostinger offer built-in protections against harmful traffic and threats.

#### Kibana

#### Chronograph

Works together with InfluxDB!

Chronograf allows you to quickly see the data that you have stored in InfluxDB so you can build robust queries and alerts. 

It is simple to use and includes templates and libraries to allow you to rapidly build dashboards with real-time visualizations of your data.
