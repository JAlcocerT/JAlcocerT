#### Redash


### Redash

[Redash is an open-source]() data visualization and dashboarding tool that is commonly used in the field of data analytics and business intelligence. It helps organizations and individuals query, visualize, and share data from various data sources to gain insights and make data-driven decisions.

{{% details title="More About Redash" closed="true" %}}

1. Data Connection: Redash allows users to connect to a wide range of data sources, including relational databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL), NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB), data warehouses (e.g., Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery), REST APIs, and more. This versatility enables data analysts to work with data from multiple sources in a unified platform.

2. Querying: Users can create SQL queries and run them within Redash to extract and transform data. The tool provides a user-friendly query builder interface, making it accessible to users with varying levels of SQL expertise.

3. Visualization: Redash offers a variety of visualization options, including charts, graphs, and pivot tables, to help users explore and understand their data. It supports popular charting libraries like Chart.js, Plotly, and more, allowing for customizable and interactive visualizations.

4. Dashboards: Users can combine multiple visualizations and queries into interactive dashboards. These dashboards can be customized and shared with others, making it easy to communicate insights and monitor key performance indicators (KPIs).

5. Collaboration: Redash supports collaboration among team members by allowing them to share queries, dashboards, and insights. This promotes knowledge sharing and facilitates data-driven decision-making within organizations.

6. Scheduled Reports: Redash enables users to schedule and automate the generation of reports and dashboards, which can be sent via email or other channels. This feature is useful for regularly distributing updated data and insights to stakeholders.

7. Embedding: Redash provides options for embedding visualizations and dashboards into other applications or websites, allowing for seamless integration of data analytics capabilities into existing workflows.

8. Data Governance: Redash provides role-based access control and data source integration, helping organizations maintain data security and governance standards.

Redash is a versatile data analytics tool that simplifies the process of querying, visualizing, and sharing data from various sources.

#### Grafana

For the IoT Fans out there: Grafana, Kibana and Chronogaph


There are many Grafana stacks, like LGTM: **L**oki, **G**rafana, **T**empo and Pro**m**etheus

{{< details title="What can I do with LGTM? ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

Ever wondered how programmers build software? If builders built houses the way programmers build software, the first woodpecker to come along would destroy civilization.

In this video, Fireship, a popular YouTube creator, takes us on a journey to instrument, collect, and visualize telemetry data from our server using open telemetry and the **LGTM stack**.


The **LGTM stack** consists of five technologies: 
- **Open Telemetry**: An industry-standard framework that collects telemetry data from software.
- **Grafana**: The frontend UI for visualizing data.
- **Prometheus**: A time-series database for storing metrics.
- **Tempo**: A database for storing traces.
- **Loki**: A database for storing logs.

Setting Up the LGTM Stack

To get started:
1. **Server Setup**: Fireship recommends using Hostinger, which offers a variety of hosting services, including a Linux virtual private server (VPS) suitable for this project.
2. **Deploying LGTM Backend**: The LGTM backend can be deployed using a Docker image provided by Graphon.
3. **Server Access**: After setting up your server on Hostinger, you can access the management dashboard and connect via SSH.

Running Grafana

1. **Verify Docker**: Use a Docker command to confirm the Docker daemon is running.
2. **Run Docker Image**: Pull the Docker image for OTel LGTM from the cloud, which may take a minute.
3. **Access Grafana**: Open the browser and navigate to the IP address on port 3000 to log into Grafana as admin.

Connecting to a Data Source

Grafana alone is not useful unless connected to a data source. Fireship demonstrates how to connect **Loki**, **Prometheus**, and **Tempo**, and then populate them with data using a sample application built with **Dino**, a framework with built-in telemetry support.

Analyzing Data with Grafana

With the LGTM stack up and running:
- Use Grafana to explore logs, metrics, and traces.
- Use **Prometheus' query language** to analyze and dive deeper into your data to identify errors and anomalies.

Takeaways

- The **LGTM stack** provides a holistic approach to software observability, enabling you to instrument, collect, and visualize telemetry data from your server.
- With the right tools, you can identify errors and anomalies in your application, allowing for data-driven decisions to improve your software.
- **Security** is crucial when deploying a telemetry backend. Services like Hostinger offer built-in protections against harmful traffic and threats.

#### Kibana

#### Chronograph

Works together with InfluxDB!

Chronograf allows you to quickly see the data that you have stored in InfluxDB so you can build robust queries and alerts. 

It is simple to use and includes templates and libraries to allow you to rapidly build dashboards with real-time visualizations of your data.
