This year I have been [trying few **VPS providers**](https://jalcocert.github.io/Linux/docs/linux__cloud/cloud/#other-clouds).

I even had the chance to benchmark some of those [VPS and compare it with a **minipc/sbc**](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/cloud-vs-single-board-computers/).

But that's not it.

How about putting all of this together...with a [Wifi2Ethernet Bridge](https://jalcocert.github.io/RPi/posts/rpi-wifi-ethernet-bridge/)?

## Setup Wireguard Server on a VPS

If you use a 3rd party VPN provider - you are skipping this step.

But its actually not complicated at all.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Use the [Hetzner Setup Script](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Linux/blob/main/Z_Cloud/Hetzner_101.sh) or the[ **SelfHosting script**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JAlcocerT/Linux/main/Z_Linux_Installations_101/Selfhosting_101.sh) as described [here](https://jalcocert.github.io/Linux/docs/linux__cloud/selfhosting/) to get **Docker ready**
{{< /callout >}}

We can use this [docker configuration](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Docker/blob/main/Security/VPNs/Wireguard_docker_compose.yaml) with pure Wireguard.

But doing it with **wgeasy** will be much simpler.

Lets do it with [wgeasy](https://github.com/wg-easy/wg-easy)

**Generate a Hashed Password**

```sh
# Create the hashed password
docker run --rm -it ghcr.io/wg-easy/wg-easy wgpw 'YOUR_PASSWORD'

docker run --rm -it ghcr.io/wg-easy/wg-easy wgpw 'YOUR_PASSWORD' | sed 's/\$/\$\$/g'
```


{{< callout type="warning" >}}
1. Don't wrap the generated hash password in single quotes when you use docker-compose.yml. Instead, replace each $ symbol with two $$ symbols. [Example](https://github.com/wg-easy/wg-easy/blob/master/How_to_generate_an_bcrypt_hash.md)

2. You'll get different results (for the same given pass) because the hash is salted
{{< /callout >}}

### WGEasy Docker Compose File

You need [this **docker configuration file**](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/RPi/blob/main/Z_Wifi2ETH/docker-compose.yml)

> Docker/Docker-Compose should be [installed already](#setup-wireguard-server-on-a-vps)

```sh
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JAlcocerT/Linux/main/Z_Linux_Installations_101/Selfhosting_101.sh
#nano Selfhosting_101.sh 
#MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU WILL BE RUNNING

chmod +x Selfhosting_101.sh
sudo ./Selfhosting_101.sh
```

Run the **wgeasy service** with CLI:

```sh
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JAlcocerT/RPi/refs/heads/main/Z_Wifi2ETH/docker-compose.yml

nano docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up -d
```

If you prefer a UI, you can use this as **Portainer Stack**:


```yaml
version: "3.8"  # Specify Docker Compose version (optional)

services:
  wg-easy:
    image: ghcr.io/wg-easy/wg-easy
    container_name: wg-easy
    environment:
      LANG: en  # Set the language for the web UI
      WG_HOST: 188.245.198.60  # Replace with your actual server IP
      PASSWORD_HASH: thisishashed!  # Replace with your generated password hash
      PORT: 51821  # Web UI port
      WG_PORT: 51820  # WireGuard UDP port
    volumes:
      - "/home/your_user/.wg-easy:/etc/wireguard"  # Mount local configuration directory (replace with absolute path)
    ports:
      - "51820:51820/udp"  # Publish WireGuard UDP port
      - "51821:51821/tcp"  # Publish Web UI port
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN  # Grant network administration capabilities
      - SYS_MODULE  # Grant access to load kernel modules (potentially risky)
    sysctls:
      net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark: "1"  # Enable source address validation
      net.ipv4.ip_forward: "1"  # Enable IP forwarding
    restart: unless-stopped  # Restart container if it crashes

# Optional Networks (if needed)
# networks:
#   wg_network:
#     driver: bridge  # Define a bridge network (optional)
```

**Verifying Your Public IP Address**

```sh
curl -sS https://ipinfo.io/json #the command to use
curl -sS http://ip-api.com/json/ #provides info about country, ISP, ...
curl -6 ifconfig.me #ipv6 info 
```

Example output (if you use **Hetzner VPS**):

```json
{
  "org": "AS24940 Hetzner Online GmbH"
}
```

> For [**D**igital **O**cean](https://jalcocert.github.io/Linux/docs/linux__cloud/cloud/#digital-ocean---do) will appear as `DigitalOcean` and with [OVH there is extra config needed](https://jalcocert.github.io/Linux/docs/linux__cloud/cloud/#ovh-cloud)


## Wireguard Client Setup

We are going to use the **Wireguard Server Credentials** that we have just created in the VPS.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
This is an alternative to [3rd parties VPNs: Mullvad, NordVPN, ProtonVPN...](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/raspberry-pi-networking/#how-to-setup-raspap)
{{< /callout >}}

Using the wgeasy UI at `http://vpsip:51821` you will be able to connect devices via QR code.

Also to download the wireguard config file.

If you raspberry pi has desktop enabled, you can just download the file and use it to configure the bridge.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
The wifi2bridge script. And the one with wireguard are here.
{{< /callout >}}

**Wireguard Client**

```sh
sudo apt install wireguard -y #The wireguard client
wg --version
# wireguard-tools v1.0.20210223 - https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-tools/
#see the status

sudo apt install resolvconf -y #required too
```


{{< callout type="info" >}}
Pass the `wg config file` via Tailscale with CLI or just create it manually via SSH
{{< /callout >}}

```sh
sudo nano /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
#nano /etc/wireguard/your_vpn_wireguard_configuration.conf #configure with CLI
#cp /home/Downloads/your_vpn_wireguard_configuration.conf /etc/wireguard #if download the config

sudo chmod 600 /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
#sudo wg-quick up wg0
```

The `wg config file` will look like:

```txt

[Interface]
PrivateKey = acoolkey
Address = 10.8.0.2/24
DNS = 1.1.1.1

[Peer]
PublicKey = anotherkey
PresharedKey = somekey
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0
PersistentKeepalive = 0
Endpoint = 188.245.vps.ip:51820
```

And just **connect your RPi Wireguard Client** to the [WG VPN Server configured at the VPS](#setup-wireguard-server-on-a-vps):

```sh
sudo wg-quick up wg0 #one time up
#sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0 #to start on BOOT
sudo systemctl status wg-quick@wg0.service
sudo wg show

#sudo wg-quick your_vpn_wireguard_configuration #the name of the .conf file that you have downloaded
#sudo wg-quick up proton #the file name would be proton.conf
```

If you want to swap VPN, just do:

```sh
sudo wg-quick down wg0 #turn off the first one

sudo nano /etc/wireguard/wg1_Ams.conf #Im using a Digital Ocean Server for this one
sudo wg-quick up wg1_Ams #one time up
```

Now, your **Pi is connected to your custom VPN Server**:

```sh
curl -sS https://ipinfo.io/json #the command to use
#curl -sS http://ip-api.com/json/ #provides info about country, ISP, ...
#curl -6 ifconfig.me #ipv6 info 

sudo apt-get install speedtest-cli
speedtest-cli #speedtest-cli --simple

ping 8.8.8.8
ping -4 google.com
```

> Oh, we are in **somewhere else now!** And the speed test is the +- the same

```json
{
  "ip": "VPSserverIP",
  "city": "Amsterdam",
  "region": "North Holland",
  "country": "NL",
  "loc": "52.3740,4.8897",
  "org": "AS14061 DigitalOcean, LLC",
  "postal": "1012",
  "timezone": "Europe/Amsterdam",
  "readme": "https://ipinfo.io/missingauth"
}
```

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Remember that **the Pi has to be WIFI connected**! And I recommend you to do so [when Installing the OS](https://jalcocert.github.io/RPi/posts/getting-started/#how-to-get-started-with-a-rpi) itself.
{{< /callout >}}

{{% details title="Checking the Pi WIFI connectivity üåç" closed="true" %}}

```sh
#nmcli dev wifi list
sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf #check WIFI creds
sudo systemctl status wpa_supplicant

ip addr show wlan0

sudo ip link set wlan0 up
rfkill list
#sudo rfkill unblock wifi
#rfkill list
```

{{% /details %}}

**If your Pi has CLI dont worry** you will pass the details when modifying the script:

```sh
ifconfig #it will have the same name as given in the wg-quick setup
#ifconfig | grep -A 5 "wg1_Ams"

curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JAlcocerT/RPi/refs/heads/main/Z_Wifi2ETH/wifi2eth_wireguard.sh
nano wifi2eth_wireguard.sh #MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU WILL BE RUNNING & INSERT THE WG NAME

chmod +x wifi2eth_wireguard.sh
sudo bash ./wifi2eth_wireguard.sh
sudo reboot
```

To make sure it starts when reeboting:
```sh
systemctl list-unit-files --type=service | grep enabled
#sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0 #to start on BOOT
sudo systemctl status wg-quick@wg0.service
```

And now, you can just **connect some device to the Pi Ethernet Port** and get VPN connection right away:

## FAQ

the Raspberry **Pi 4 supports 5 GHz Wi-Fi**, as it comes with a built-in `Wi-Fi 802.11ac` (Wi-Fi 5) adapter.

This means that the Pi 4 can connect to both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz Wi-Fi networks.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
You can also use **[TailScale](https://jalcocert.github.io/Linux/docs/debian/linux_vpn_setup/#tailscale) VPN** on your devices.
