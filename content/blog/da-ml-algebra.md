**Tl;DR**

Most likely you got bored in math classes, you will love this post though.

**Intro**

Algebra was one of my favourite subjects in my first year of uni studies.

> And blindly multiplying matrixes was the most painful and procrastinated task for me to do in high school.

And its been a while since I have had the chance to do cool stuff with it.

Until today.
