**Tl;DR**

We want it all "Good, Fast, Cheap". 

> This is the project management trilemma.

Fortunately, there are **project management tools** to help you!

**Intro**: As a PM in any project, you will need to:

1. Take good [notes](#note-taking-apps)
2. Create proper [PPTs](#creating-presentations-ppts) and diagrams
3. Be aware of the [PRD/BRD/FRD](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/brd-vs-frd-for-data-analytics/)...
4. How much [time](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/time-management-data-analytics/) and [focus](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/tools-to-improve-focus/) matter
5. Be good with your [Architect](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/data-analytics-architecture/) and [BA](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/business-analytics-skills/)


## Note Taking Apps

Call it [note taking](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/knowledge-management/).

Call it knowledge management.

The thing is that you needs this in the information era.
