It all started few years ago with my **own travel blog**.

Later on, my first business website followed.


{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="https://cyclingthere.com" title="My Travel Adventures" image="/blog_img/web/WebsSnapshots/Web_CyclingThere.png" subtitle="I can write and also create interesting photo galleries about my travel experiences" >}}
  {{< card link="https://iotechcrafts.com/" title="Business Website" image="/blog_img/web/WebsSnapshots/Web_IoTechCrafts.png" subtitle="A Website for Agency - AI & IoT Consulting Services" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

And then I saw **people close to me, who needed help**.

But what can you do when there are **many unknown unknowns**?

Maybe...Clarify with [an **AI Powered** Presentation](https://fc9dafcc.creaitivewebsites.pages.dev)

## Custom Websites

Then...started customizing websites:

    {{< card link="https://jmodels.net/" title="Scale Modelling Blog" image="/blog_img/web/WebsSnapshots/Web-jmodels.png" subtitle="Fantastic Blog with ~1K Posts about Modelling" >}}
    {{< card link="https://ira-english.pages.dev/" title="Personal Business Landing" image="/blog_img/web/WebsSnapshots/Web_EnglishIra.png" subtitle="Landing Page for a well Known English Teacher" >}}
    {{< card link="https://enjoylittlethings.org/" title="Travel Adict Photo Gallery" image="/blog_img/web/WebsSnapshots/Web_PhotoGalleryAGA.png" subtitle="Because Photo & Travel lovers need something more than instagram" >}}    
    {{< card link="https://jalcocert.github.io/Portfolio/" title="All your Links" image="/blog_img/web/WebsSnapshots/Web_PortfolioLinks.png" subtitle="Sleek collection of important Links" >}} 
    {{< card link="https://iodoctor.iotechcrafts.com/" title="Doctor Consultation" image="/blog_img/web/WebsSnapshots/Web_IoDoctor.png" subtitle="Landing and WebApp for Scheduling Doctor Appointments" >}}

## Next Steps

Making a better [LinkTree](https://linktr.ee/s/pricing/) or [linkbio](https://www.linknbio.com/pricing)

At the moment of writing, they are charging 5$/m for the first paid tier.

It goes to 9$/m to have newsletter and web analytics...or customize the UI.

<!-- {{< callout type="info" >}}
A cool UI is mostly [a matter of CSS](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/blog/dev-css/)
{{< /callout >}} -->



<!-- 
Gain deeper insights with comprehensive location/referrer based analytics and conversion tracking
Collect email addresses and phone numbers directly from your Linktree to build your own visitor list
Marketing tech capabilities including SEO settings, Google Analytics, Zapier, and Mailchimp integrations -->

### Scaling Ideas

These are some ideas of whats coming next.

Making websites 1 by 1 its kind of slow.

But there are very well known services that provide interesting service without human interaction.

1) [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/s/pricing/)
2) [linkbio](https://www.linknbio.com/pricing)
3) [Glow (F/OSS)](https://github.com/tryglow/glow)
4) https://www.stan.store/

* Examples, this [artist profile](https://linktr.ee/bogusia.adryan) and this [awsome designer profile](https://linktr.ee/karwozniak)
    * And somethin' like:
        * https://github.com/jpanther/lynx - MIT!
        * https://github.com/SofiDevO/allmylinks
        * https://github.com/DBozhinovski/astro-theme-ltree - TinaCMS!

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Like we did at the **Social Media Project!**
{{< /callout >}}

* Weddings...
* bodas.net

* **Automatic Invoices**
  * With Stripe as payment gateway, they create the invoices for your product/services automatically
  * There are some project to [create invoices with open software](https://fossengineer.com/open-source-invoice-creator/) - **Serverless Invoices** worked great for me!


{{% details title="ServerLess-Invoices Setup ðŸš€" closed="true" %}}

Create and manage invoices in your browser. Serverless Invoices is a free invoicing tool for freelancers and small businesses. 

**Made with Vue.js.** 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mokuappio/serverless-invoices.git
#https://github.com/JAlcocerT/serverless-invoices

cd serverless-invoices
#rm -rf .git

docker build . -t mokuappio/serverless-invoices
#docker run -p 89:8080 -d --rm mokuappio/serverless-invoices
docker run -p 89:8080 -d --rm --name serverlessinvoices mokuappio/serverless-invoices

```

> There is an awsome [Dockerfile example](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/serverless-invoices/blob/main/Dockerfile) on how to bundle a Node App for Production

You can print to pdf, add your logo, taxes, CSS...

...**and import/export the json with all your created invoices**

* Or use their Saas: https://app.mokuapp.io/login
