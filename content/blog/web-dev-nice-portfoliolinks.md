## A Better way to Show your Work

We all have **awsome stuff done**, but on our phone.

Let's give others the chance to benefit from our ideas/project/services.

**Make it available for them.**

You can do similarly in a VPS Server, like this one we used for Flask

I [developed it within my OrangePi with SSH](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/blog/dev-in-docker/) and also had to stop portainer so that TinaCMS could run `sudo docker stop portainer`

{{< details title="Proposing a Quick HUGO Theme ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

[JPanther Contributions](https://github.com/jpanther) are amazing.

And the **Lynx Theme** is not an exception.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jpanther/lynx #MIT Licensed, Thanks again, James!
cd ./lynx

git clone https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Portfolio
cd ./Portfolio
```


Get **GO & HUGO Ready** as per [this related post](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/blog/using-hugo-as-website/).

```sh
#sudo apt install ufw
#sudo ufw allow 1313

hugo server #http://192.168.0.117:1313/
#hugo server --bind 0.0.0.0 --baseURL http://192.168.0.117
#hugo server --bind 192.168.0.117 --baseURL http://192.168.0.117 #it will bind it to a random port
hugo server --bind 0.0.0.0 --baseURL http://192.168.0.117 --port 1313 #
```

Now you can dev HUGO as I did, on a [server with VSCode and SSH](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/blog/dev-in-docker/) at: `http://192.168.0.117:1313`

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Updating Links"

git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
