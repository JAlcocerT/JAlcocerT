## Git 101

Initialize git:

```sh
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
```
<!-- 
1. go to the repo folder 
2. right click on the .git folder and choose the last option - properties
3. on the general tab uncheck hidden checkbox if checked
4. hit apply and then ok -->

Create a new git repository and push it:

```sh
git init
touch README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin <remote_repository_url>
git push -u origin master
```


{{< details title="More GIT useful commands ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

```sh
git pull origin master	# Fetches and merges changes from the remote master branch to your local branch
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master	# Sets the default upstream branch to origin/master for the current local branch

git add README.md	# Adds the README.md file to the staging area, marking it for inclusion in the next commit
git add .	# Adds all new and modified files to the staging area

git commit -m "description of changes"	# Commits the staged changes to the local repository with a description "description of changes"
git push	# Pushes the commits from your local branch to the corresponding remote branch
git push origin master	# Pushes the commits from your local master branch to the remote master branch

git rm -r -f .idea	# Recursively and forcefully removes the .idea directory from the project and stages the removal for commit

git -ignore .idea/*	# Incorrect command, possibly meant to add '.idea/*' to a .gitignore file
nano .gitignore	# Opens the .gitignore file in the nano editor to manually add rules

git branch v01	# Creates a new branch named v01 based on the current branch
git checkout master	# Switches to the master branch
get merge v01 master	# Incorrect command, possibly meant to be 'git merge v01' while on master branch to merge changes from v01 into master
git push origin master	# Pushes the commits from your local master branch to the remote master branch
```

```sh
git reset HEAD~3 #remove the last 3 commits in case you pass some secret (but keep the changes in files)
```

### Branch Management 

Check how many branches there are:

```sh
git branch -a #list them all
git branch #and in which one you are
#git branch -D some_branch_name #delete a local branch
```

Change to another (new local) branch with:

```sh
git checkout other_branch_name #git checkout tests
```

And if the branch **already exists in the repo**, change to it with:

```sh
git checkout -b other_branch_name origin/other_branch_name #will pull and swap you to it
```

See the latest commit:

```sh
git log --oneline #exit with q
```

Make your changes, commit and push to the specified branch with:

```sh
git add <file-name>
git commit -m "Your commit message" #git commit -m "Adding the script that creates testing scenarios from random combinations of the initial provided table"
git push origin other_branch_name #tests
```

### How to add an image to a Gist

How to add an image to a gist

Create a gist if you haven't already. And then...

Clone your gist:

```sh
# make sure to replace `<hash>` with your gist's hash
git clone https://gist.github.com/<hash>.git # with https 
#git clone https://gist.github.com/c043e6645a8786f55640e5fbccbaea00.git
git clone git@gist.github.com:<hash>.git     # or with ssh
#Add your image to your gist's repository:

git add your-image.jpg
#Commit the image:

git commit -m "Add image"
#Update gist:

git push origin master
```
