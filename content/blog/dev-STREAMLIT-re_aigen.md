## Streamlit Calculator and GenAI RE Agent

I was building a simple web app RE calculator with Streamlit to explore:



* https://streamlit.io/
  * https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit
  * https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit?tab=Apache-2.0-1-ov-file#readme
  * https://pypi.org/project/streamlit/"

Its time to put few pieces together, and add Generative ai capabilities:

### The AI Tech Stack

{{< tabs items="Full-Fledge,PoC Gen AI,Market Test" >}}

  {{< tab >}}
  Complex and full fledge setup: with RAG, embeddings and 2 LLMs

  1. **RAGs**: LlamaIndex, Mem0 together with HuggingFaceEmbedding(model_name="BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5")

  2. **LLMs**: OpenAI, [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/all-models)

  ```sh
  OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-yourapikey #https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-yourapi #https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
  ```
  {{< /tab >}}

  {{< tab >}}
  How about keeping it simple with just OpenAI?
  {{< /tab >}}

  {{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

Whatever option you choose, see how the **Streamlit App is done modular**:

```sh
import streamlit as st
import os
from UDF_st_logic import re_calculator_ui #the magic happens here
from UDF_GenAI import st_openai_md_genai #and here :)

import UDF_Auth_functions as af

def main():
    if af.login(): #Simple Auth Layer
        genai_mode = os.getenv("GenAI_MODE", False)

        if genai_mode and genai_mode.lower() == "true":  # Check if env var exists and is "true"
            re_calculator_ui()
            st_openai_md_genai()
        else:
            re_calculator_ui()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

> About each of those pieces, I was writing a little bit already

Once you have the app ready, we go to the containers part:

```sh
#sudo docker image build -t re_calc_genai:v6b . > build.log 2>&1
sudo docker image build --progress=plain -t re_calc_genai:v6b . 2>&1 | tee build.log
```

You will need to provide **valid SSL certificates** after that:

  {{< card link="https://fossengineer.com/selfhosting-cloudflared-tunnel-docker/" title="Cloudflared â†—" icon="book-open" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

You can have now a **real estate aigent** that provides 24/7 recommendations about properties:

The data? Pure markdown or `.mdx` from the site itself:

You can use a live editor to get around markdown: https://dillinger.io/




## Conclusions


I have also been tinkering with a Web App framework alternative, Reflex:

## Outro

### Streamlit Features for PoC

You will need **https** to have credibility that you build something solid.

Remember that the visible Streamlit App name in the **browser tab**, will match the name of the **Python streamlit main file**!

#### Features under a Wall

So far, Ive come across few ways (x4) to place **authentication on top of Streamlit Apps**:

1. The `st.login` built in feature: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/user/st.login

{{< cards >}}

{{< /cards >}}

##### Provided Users and Pass

2. By using the `streamlit-authenticator` library, only my client can access it:

![Streamlit User Auth](/blog_img/biz/RE/re-tool-userauth.png)

Its all about: https://pypi.org/project/streamlit-authenticator/

{{< details title="There is a sample of this PoC authentication at MultiChat or RE Photo Tool ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

{{< callout type="info" >}}
With this method, you can have several hardcoded `user/password` created!

##### Email Verification

Recently I got to know also about this project to verify emails:

* https://rapid-email-verifier.fly.dev/

> MIT | Privacy-first, Free, **Open Source email verifier**


{{< details title="How to use Rapid Email Verifier? ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}


{{< /details >}}


3. You can also do the trick by passing the hard work to a 3rd party **subscription newsletter**, like `mailerlite`, and you will query its API.

4. Using **Stripe API**: if an user have an active subscription or free tier evalution, it can go ahead and use your Streamlit App

> Points 2 and 3 are features that I have explored with the AIssistant project:

##### With Other Containers

You're asking for a self-hostable solution that combines frontend *and* user management (registration, login, access control). 

That narrows the options considerably, as most frontend frameworks rely on a separate backend.

Here are some strong contenders, keeping in mind that "self-hostable" implies you control the server:



{{< details title="Keycloak, Supabase, Authentic, LogTo,... ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

**1. Keycloak (Identity and Access Management):**

* **Type:**  Full-fledged IAM solution.
* **Pros:**  Very powerful and flexible, supports various authentication protocols (OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, SAML), social logins, multi-factor authentication, fine-grained authorization.  Can act as your authentication server.
* **Cons:**  Can be complex to set up and configure, requires Java knowledge (as it's built on Java).  It's a dedicated service, so you still need a separate frontend.
* **Frontend Integration:**  You would integrate Keycloak with your chosen frontend framework (React, Vue, Angular, etc.) using its client libraries.  Keycloak provides JavaScript adapters to simplify this.
* **Good for:**  Applications that require robust authentication and authorization, especially if you need single sign-on (SSO) across multiple services.

**2. Supabase (Open Source Alternative to Firebase):**

* **Type:**  Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) that you can self-host (though they also offer a hosted service).
* **Pros:**  Provides authentication, database (PostgreSQL), storage, edge functions, and more.  Easy to use, good documentation.  Has client libraries for various frontend frameworks.
* **Cons:**  Self-hosting requires managing the underlying infrastructure. While open-source, some features might require a paid plan if you use their hosted service.
* **Frontend Integration:**  Supabase provides JavaScript libraries that make it easy to integrate authentication and other backend services into your frontend application.
* **Good for:**  Projects where you need a quick setup with a full backend suite, including user authentication.

**3. Appwrite (Open Source Backend Server):**

* **Type:**  Open-source backend server similar to Supabase.
* **Pros:**  Provides authentication, database, storage, functions, and more.  Focuses on developer experience.  Has client SDKs for various platforms.
* **Cons:**  Relatively newer than Supabase, so the community is still growing.
* **Frontend Integration:**  Appwrite offers SDKs for frontend frameworks, simplifying the integration process.
* **Good for:**  Projects where you need a self-hosted backend with a focus on developer-friendliness.

**4. Self-Hosting a Custom Backend (Node.js, Python/Django/Flask, etc.):**

* **Type:**  You build your own backend.
* **Pros:**  Maximum flexibility and control.
* **Cons:**  Requires significant development effort, you're responsible for all aspects, including security.
* **Frontend Integration:**  Your frontend would communicate with your custom backend via API calls (REST or GraphQL).
* **Good for:**  Projects with very specific requirements that cannot be met by existing solutions, or where you need complete control.  This is generally the most complex path.

**5. Nhost (Open Source Firebase Alternative):**

* **Type:** Open-source platform for building serverless web apps.
* **Pros:** Provides authentication, storage, GraphQL API, and Postgres database.
* **Cons:**  Requires some knowledge of GraphQL.
* **Frontend Integration:**  Nhost provides SDKs for integrating with your frontend.
* **Good for:**  Projects where you need a backend with GraphQL API and serverless functions.

6. LogTo

{{< /details >}}

**Recommendation:**

* **For most cases, especially if you're not already deeply invested in a specific backend technology, Supabase or Appwrite are excellent starting points.** They offer a good balance of ease of use and functionality.  They handle the complexities of user authentication and provide you with the tools to quickly integrate it into your frontend.
* **If you need a very robust and flexible IAM solution and are comfortable with the complexity, Keycloak is a powerful choice.**
* **If you have very specific requirements or want complete control, building your own backend is an option, but it's the most time-consuming.**

Remember that even with these self-hostable options, you'll still need to choose a frontend framework (React, Vue, etc.) to build the user interface of your application.

## FAQ

### How to prepare a Tech Talk with SliDevJS

1. Its very important to instruct the LLM to provide you a clear, but concise agenda (work markdown icons as optional). Similar in lenght to the one provided by SliDev
2. Add your mermaidJS diagrams for visual explanations of the flow

```sh
#git clone https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Data-Chat
npm init slidev@latest
```
