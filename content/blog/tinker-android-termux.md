{{< details title="OrangePi 5 with Latest Kernel ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}
* [Installing OS](https://jalcocert.github.io/RPi/posts/getting-started/) with latest kernel thanks to [Joshua-Riek](https://joshua-riek.github.io/ubuntu-rockchip-download/boards/orangepi-5b.html)
  * Remember that they are not the [official ones](https://github.com/orangepi-xunlong/orangepi-build)!
  * I have tried the 6.1.75 version, which has HDMI support working
  * Other 3rd party images: **[Armbian](https://www.armbian.com/orangepi-5/)**

* You can boot RPi5 from NVMe [like so](https://jalcocert.github.io/RPi/posts/pi-vs-orange/#using-nvme-with-the-orange-pi-5)
  * The SD card will still have the boot priority (if it's there)
