It was about time to put this together.

Selling websites 1 by 1 can be good for starters.

Even before that, you have this kind of journey:

1. S**k at something
2. Do it for free
3. Repeat n times
4. Get better
5. Start $
6. Swap free for $

As demand can grow when you get better at something, you will need to increase the supply.

As your time is limited, you will want to scale the ideas **with tech**: 

*Via LogTo Authentication plugged into a Flask WebApp called... Webifyer or...WebifAI or...WebGenerAItor...*

And shame on me, I have not been tinkering with Stripe since last year [with the CV project](https://gitlab.com/fossengineer1/cv-check/-/blob/main/Z_Auth_Ways/Z_Auth_Stripe.py?ref_type=heads) as per [these tests](https://gitlab.com/fossengineer1/cv-check/-/tree/main/Z_Tests/Stripe?ref_type=heads).

What we will be covering on this post:

1. How to setup Stripe integration to sell like a Pro
2. Recap on how to authenticate users into your Flask Apps
3. Using Flask as a simple CMS for Astro Themes
4. Configure subdomains for Cloudflare as per Flask 

## Stripe

Because you wont to bill people. Probably.

* You can login https://dashboard.stripe.com/login
* Set your accepted payment methods: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/payment_methods/
* And create a product / subscription

You can create payment links with stripe, like this: https://buy.stripe.com/6oEg2n1pu15j9UcbII or this on test mode https://buy.stripe.com/test_00g3d29cj0IM9l68ww

I liked the stripe integrations with cal.com or zapier.

![alt text](/blog_img/entrepre/stripe/stripe-apps.png)

But you can use those to put the links into your app *And embedd them into your flask app*

Go to stripe developer section: https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/overview


You can add a custom domain to stripe via [these instructions](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/custom-domains?nameserver-provider=cloudflare) and *paying the monthly subscriptionfor 10$/month*

![alt text](/blog_img/entrepre/stripe/stripe-customdomain.png)


The stripe docs are great and have a lot of resources for dev, like the workbench:

* https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys
* https://docs.stripe.com/testing

![alt text](/blog_img/entrepre/stripe/stripe-dev-workbench.png)

You might want to get started with payment links. Like this one https://buy.stripe.com/test_14A3cvfV98LE2X6dLA4ko01

You can add coupons/promo codes to certain products/subs, as per https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/coupons

![alt text](/blog_img/entrepre/stripe/stripe-paymentlink.png)

![alt text](/blog_img/entrepre/stripe/stripe-paymentlink-code.png)

We have the Stripe Python SDK: https://pypi.org/project/stripe/ that allow to [embed payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/share#embed-button) into our Flask app, provided the

![alt text](/blog_img/entrepre/stripe/stripe-sdk.png)

```sh
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
STRIPE_PRODUCT_ID=
```

> You can even pass few [parameters to the buy button](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/buy-button) (like the email) so that its prefilled as per the logged in / auth customer

Which can also be embedded into Flask (option below). Just hit the `Buy button` next to the link to get the code and vibe-code it.

Stripe Integration Approaches in Flask

This document summarizes two main ways to integrate Stripe payments into your Flask web application, with pros, cons, and typical use cases.

---

1. Python Module Stripe Integration (Custom Payment Form)

**Names:**
- Custom Stripe Integration
- Stripe Payment Element Integration
- Server-side Stripe API Integration
- Programmatic Stripe Checkout

**Description:**
You use the official `stripe` Python SDK to create PaymentIntents and control the payment flow from your backend. The frontend uses Stripe.js to render a secure, customizable payment form (Payment Element) directly on your site.

- Full control over pricing, metadata, and customer experience.
- Good for dynamic/complex products, custom UI, or when you need to store extra info.
- Payment is processed on your domain, users never leave your site.

**Use cases:**
- Dynamic pricing, multiple products, or custom checkout flows.
- Need to collect extra information from the user.
- Want to tightly integrate Stripe with your backend logic.

---

2. Stripe Buy Button Integration

**Names:**
- Stripe Buy Button
- No-code Stripe Button
- Client-side Stripe Checkout Button
- Hosted Stripe Buy Button

**Description:**
You embed a pre-configured Stripe Buy Button using the Stripe-provided JavaScript snippet. Stripe handles the checkout flow, pricing, and product selection.

- Easiest and fastest to set up.
- Minimal backend code required.
- Best for simple, fixed-price products or quick MVPs.
- Users are redirected to Stripe-hosted checkout for payment.

**Use cases:**
- Simple, static products or services.
- Want to get up and running quickly with minimal code.
- No need for custom checkout logic or complex backend integration.

---

Summary Table

| Approach Name                  | Control Level | Setup Complexity | Use Case                                 |
|------------------------------- |:-------------:|:----------------:|------------------------------------------|
| Stripe Payment Element (Python)| High          | Moderate         | Custom flows, dynamic pricing, advanced  |
| Stripe Buy Button              | Low           | Very Easy        | Simple, static products, fast deployment |

---

Choose the approach that best fits your projectâ€™s needs. For most custom web apps, the Payment Element approach offers maximum flexibility. For simple or rapid deployments, the Buy Button is ideal.

*With the payment link embedded,the user will be redirected to a new tab for payment with a buy.stripe.com domain*

![alt text](/blog_img/entrepre/stripe/stripe-link-ok.png)


**To enable WebHooks with Stripe**

* https://docs.stripe.com/cli/login
* https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli?install-method=linux

```sh
#https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/releases/tag/v1.27.0
wget https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/releases/download/v1.27.0/stripe_1.27.0_linux_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i stripe_1.27.0_linux_amd64.deb

stripe login
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:5006/webhook

#python3 app-v4.1.py
```

Once that its done, you can vibe code again to have real time updates for the logged in user:

![Stripe Webhooks](/blog_img/entrepre/stripe/stripe-webhook-flask.png)

### Stripe x Logto

I have been recently playing with [LogTo and Flask on this repo folder](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/ThreeBodies/tree/main/LogTo)

Where I could get proper sing up/in and user email information via LogTo as per:

```sh
python3 ./Logto/logto-sample-v2.py
```

So now just do:

```sh
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate

uv pip install -r requirements.txt

uv run ./LogTo-Stripe/logto-stripe-app-v5.py
#stripe listen --forward-to localhost:5088/webhook #The Stripe CLI (used for local development) is not needed in production. In production, Stripe will POST directly to your serverâ€™s public /webhook endpoint.
```

Dont forget to add the **after payment behaviour** into your stripe payment link, so that it gets redirected to `http://192.168.1.6:5088`

![Stripe Payment link - Redirects to Flask](/blog_img/entrepre/stripe/stripe-redirect.png)

> Thanks to the cookies, that new tab will be already logged into and authenticated per LogTo to the flask admin panel, showing that you have got the service

If you have done everything properly, you can get this kind of user journey in production, with https and no paid tiers *as of the time of writting*

![alt text](/blog_img/entrepre/webify/webify-logto-login.png)

> If you want the [google](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth) signin/up, you will need a Logto Subscription as seen [here](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/testing-tinyauth/#logto-authentication)

![alt text](/blog_img/entrepre/webify/wibify-logto-customdomain.png)

Which is the result of:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/JAlcocerT/WebifAI
docker build -t webifai:latest .

# docker run --env-file .env.prod -p 5088:5088 \
#   -v $(pwd)/payments.db:/app/payments.db \
#   --network cloudflared_tunnel \
#   --name webifai webifai:latest
ping webify.jalcocertech.com
```

![Flask Webify Working via Cloudflare Tunnels](/blog_img/entrepre/webify/webify-logto-loggedin.png)

## Flask x SSG Themes

How about making the user select the desired theme for its website.

### Astro Themes

We can do this potentially for any SSG.

Like for a HUGO theme, like Lynx and your Portfolio:

```sh
docker run -d \
  --name hugo \
  -p 1313:1313 \
  -v /home/jalcocert/Desktop/IT/Code2Prompt-Test/WebGenerAItor/Portfolio/:/src \
  --network proxy \
  klakegg/hugo:0.101.0 \
  server --bind 0.0.0.0 --port 1313
```

Then you can plug NGINX to serve the static files and provide HTTPs via Traefik programatically, via [this kind of docker compose](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/WebGenerAItor/blob/main/docker-compose.yml#L60)

The part of building, serving, adding https...is very clear.

Even updating DNS via Cloudflare API: https://github.com/JAlcocerT/WebGenerAItor/tree/main/Cloudflare_DNS

And calling that CF API via Flask: https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Streamlit_PoC/blob/main/flask_dnsupdater.py

But how about editing the themes?

Or just...adding new content at least?

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/docplanner-web-migration/" title="Astro Theme 101 for Webifyer" image="/blog_img/web/WebsSnapshots/Web_Nevin.png" subtitle="For a psycology centered portfolio | Post" >}}
  {{< card link="https://github.com/JAlcocerT/morita-web" title="Astro Theme x Webifyer Sample" image="/blog_img/apps/gh-jalcocert.svg" subtitle="Source Code on Github of a sample first 10 websites to combine with Webifyer" >}}
{{< /cards >}}


So I put these one inside the repo folder: `./Astro-Themes`

```sh
git clone https://github.com/JAlcocerT/morita-web #npm create astro@latest -- --template portfolio

cd ./Astro-Themes/morita-web
rm -r .git
```




## Choosing a Domain

In this case it will be a **sub**domain.

And we will be needing from Cloudflare:

```py
CLOUDFLARE_API = 'https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4'
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN = os.getenv('CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN')
CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID = os.getenv('CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID')
DOMAIN = os.getenv('CLOUDFLARE_DOMAIN')  # e.g., jalcocertech.com
```

### Automatic DNS Setup

So how about choosing that subdomain, and getting it configured on the backend to point properly?

---

## Conclusions

This was quite a ride.

You have learn how to:

1. Get Flask working with Logto https://authentication.jalcocertech.com/ or https://oxa37q.logto.app/sign-in

The flows assume the you want to login and give the signup as option (like most apps do)

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/testing-tinyauth/#logto-authentication" title="LogTo 101" image="/blog_img/entrepre/stripe/logto-tnc-policy.png" subtitle="Using Logto with Flask WebApp | Post" >}}
{{< /cards >}}


2. Get Stripe API working inside the flask App with a DB and webhooks for updates

OpenAI or Windsurf are also using stripe to charge you

Normally you have a billing section in the web app that redirects to the logged in user to its stripe related info on subscriptions

Example: https://billing.stripe.com/p/session/live_YWNjdF8xTlJsomethingmorehere

![alt text](/blog_img/entrepre/webify/stripe-windsurf-sample.png)

3. Concurrency for Flask apps is better via Gunicorn and it can be included in the Dockerfiles like:

```dockerfile
#CMD python3 logto-stripe-app-v5prod.py
CMD ["gunicorn", "logto-stripe-app-v5prod:app", "-b", "0.0.0.0:5088"]
```

It is designed to efficiently serve your app to many users at once, with support for multiple worker processes and better handling of concurrent requests than Flaskâ€™s built-in server.

4. Plugging [Umami](#adding-umami-web-analytics-to-flask) to the full Flask Routes and [in-App Formbricks](#adding-formbricks-to-flask)

{{< callout type="info" >}}
I would not have managed to do this without containers and [Cloudflare Tunnels](https://fossengineer.com/selfhosting-cloudflared-tunnel-docker/)
{{< /callout >}}


### Adding Umami Web Analytics to Flask

* https://github.com/ImShyMike/Flask-Umami
* https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Umami/

Add your new website to [Umami](https://fossengineer.com/selfhosting-umami-with-docker/): with domain without http/s like: `flask.jalcocertech.com`

Ive put that together into the `./Z_Tests/Umami` folder of the repo.

```sh
uv run python flask-umami-101.py 
```

Got happily surprised to see it working also on the local network (as well as via https with CF tunnels)

![alt text](/blog_img/entrepre/webify/flask-umami.png)

![alt text](/blog_img/entrepre/webify/flask-tc-sample.png)

### Adding Formbricks to Flask

So if you have created Formbricks links, like this one: https://app.formbricks.com/s/cmc6gnjc1bx06xg01xizn1g1y

You know you can embedd them:

![alt text](/blog_img/entrepre/webify/formbricks-link-embed.png)


But it will work better if you select the webapp category (embedded into the product):

![alt text](/blog_img/entrepre/webify/formbricks-webapp-survey.png)

![alt text](/blog_img/entrepre/webify/formbrick-webapp.png)


And then: https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/surveys/website-app-surveys/quickstart

Like this one: https://app.formbricks.com/s/cmcg5qxve55q0ww01wqc2jdo7

![alt text](/blog_img/entrepre/webify/formbrick-html-snippet-for-flask.png)

{{< callout type="info" >}}
With the last method, you can customize via FormBricks when the pop-up appears, to show to how many users, when to close it...all without existing flask
{{< /callout >}}

**The result of that formbricks html embed** can look like so (and its also great on phone):

```sh
uv run python ./Z_Tests/Formbricks/flask-umami-formbricks-v3.py #working v3 with formbricks embedded via html and also umami
```

> You will need to get the `environment_id` from Formbricks UI.

![alt text](/blog_img/entrepre/webify/flask-formbricks-umami.png)

**Just mind the difference of link vs app**: for Flask, the app version + html embedd was my go to

![alt text](/blog_img/entrepre/webify/formbrick-link-vs-app.png)


### T&C and Privacy

Never forget to add such records into your SaaS

![alt text](/blog_img/entrepre/webify/flask-terms-privacy.png)

You can use the static routes so that any user registering, will have to accept that agree with these conditions as per LogTo.

### OG for Flask


Add Open Graph meta tags to your HTML <head> on the landing page:

```html
<meta property="og:title" content="WebifAI: The Website you deserve is just 1 min ahead of you">
<meta property="og:description" content="A blueprint Flask WebApp to authenticate via Logto and Sell via Stripe.">
<meta property="og:image" content="https://yourdomain.com/static/Gemini_Generated.jpeg">
<meta property="og:type" content="website">
<meta property="og:url" content="https://yourdomain.com/">
```

Replace https://yourdomain.com/ with your actual domain.
