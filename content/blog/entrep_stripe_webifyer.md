It was about time to put this together.

Selling websites 1 by 1 can be good for starters.

But you will want to scale the ideas.

And shame on me, I have not been tinkering with Stripe since last year [with the CV project](https://gitlab.com/fossengineer1/cv-check/-/blob/main/Z_Auth_Ways/Z_Auth_Stripe.py?ref_type=heads) as per [these tests](https://gitlab.com/fossengineer1/cv-check/-/tree/main/Z_Tests/Stripe?ref_type=heads).

## Stripe

Because you wont to bill people. Probably.

* You can login https://dashboard.stripe.com/login
* Set your accepted payment methods: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/payment_methods/
* And create a product / subscription

You can create payment links with stripe, like this: https://buy.stripe.com/6oEg2n1pu15j9UcbII or this on test mode https://buy.stripe.com/test_00g3d29cj0IM9l68ww

I liked the stripe integrations with cal.com or zapier.

But you can use those to put the links into your app *And embedd them into your flask app*

Go to stripe developer section: https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/overview


You can add a custom domain to stripe via [these instructions](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/custom-domains?nameserver-provider=cloudflare) and *paying the monthly subscriptionfor 10$/month*

![alt text](/blog_img/entrepre/stripe/stripe-customdomain.png)


The stripe docs are great and have a lot of resources for dev, like the workbench:

* https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys
* https://docs.stripe.com/testing

![alt text](/blog_img/entrepre/stripe/stripe-dev-workbench.png)

You might want to get started with payment links. Like this one https://buy.stripe.com/test_14A3cvfV98LE2X6dLA4ko01

You can add coupons/promo codes to certain products/subs, as per https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/coupons

![alt text](/blog_img/entrepre/stripe/stripe-paymentlink.png)

![alt text](/blog_img/entrepre/stripe/stripe-paymentlink-code.png)

We have the Stripe Python SDK: https://pypi.org/project/stripe/ that allow to [embed payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/share#embed-button) into our Flask app, provided the

![alt text](/blog_img/entrepre/stripe/stripe-sdk.png)

```sh
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
STRIPE_PRODUCT_ID=
```

> You can even pass few [parameters to the buy button](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/buy-button) (like the email) so that its prefilled as per the logged in / auth customer

Which can also be embedded into Flask (option below). Just hit the `Buy button` next to the link to get the code and vibe-code it.

Stripe Integration Approaches in Flask

This document summarizes two main ways to integrate Stripe payments into your Flask web application, with pros, cons, and typical use cases.

---

1. Python Module Stripe Integration (Custom Payment Form)

**Names:**
- Custom Stripe Integration
- Stripe Payment Element Integration
- Server-side Stripe API Integration
- Programmatic Stripe Checkout

**Description:**
You use the official `stripe` Python SDK to create PaymentIntents and control the payment flow from your backend. The frontend uses Stripe.js to render a secure, customizable payment form (Payment Element) directly on your site.

- Full control over pricing, metadata, and customer experience.
- Good for dynamic/complex products, custom UI, or when you need to store extra info.
- Payment is processed on your domain, users never leave your site.

**Use cases:**
- Dynamic pricing, multiple products, or custom checkout flows.
- Need to collect extra information from the user.
- Want to tightly integrate Stripe with your backend logic.

---

2. Stripe Buy Button Integration

**Names:**
- Stripe Buy Button
- No-code Stripe Button
- Client-side Stripe Checkout Button
- Hosted Stripe Buy Button

**Description:**
You embed a pre-configured Stripe Buy Button using the Stripe-provided JavaScript snippet. Stripe handles the checkout flow, pricing, and product selection.

- Easiest and fastest to set up.
- Minimal backend code required.
- Best for simple, fixed-price products or quick MVPs.
- Users are redirected to Stripe-hosted checkout for payment.

**Use cases:**
- Simple, static products or services.
- Want to get up and running quickly with minimal code.
- No need for custom checkout logic or complex backend integration.

Summary Table

| Approach Name                  | Control Level | Setup Complexity | Use Case                                 |
|------------------------------- |:-------------:|:----------------:|------------------------------------------|
| Stripe Payment Element (Python)| High          | Moderate         | Custom flows, dynamic pricing, advanced  |
| Stripe Buy Button              | Low           | Very Easy        | Simple, static products, fast deployment |

---

Choose the approach that best fits your projectâ€™s needs. For most custom web apps, the Payment Element approach offers maximum flexibility. For simple or rapid deployments, the Buy Button is ideal.

*With the payment link embedded,the user will be redirected to a new tab for payment with a buy.stripe.com domain*

**To enable WebHooks with Stripe**

* https://docs.stripe.com/cli/login
* https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli?install-method=linux

```sh
#https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/releases/tag/v1.27.0
wget https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/releases/download/v1.27.0/stripe_1.27.0_linux_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i stripe_1.27.0_linux_amd64.deb

stripe login
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:5006/webhook

#python3 app-v4.1.py
```

Once that its done, you can vibe code again to have real time updates for the logged in user:

### Stripe x Logto

I have been recently playing with [LogTo and Flask on this repo folder](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/ThreeBodies/tree/main/LogTo)

Where I could get proper sing up/in and user email information via LogTo as per:

```sh
python3 ./Logto/logto-sample-v2.py
```

So now:

```sh
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate

uv pip install -r requirements.txt


uv run logto-stripe-app-v5.py
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:5088/webhook
```

Dont forget to add the **after payment behaviour** into your stripe payment link, so that it gets redirected to `http://192.168.1.6:5088`

![alt text](/blog_img/entrepre/stripe/stripe-redirect.png)

> Thanks to the cookies, that new tab will be already logged into and authenticated per LogTo to the flask admin panel, showing that you have got the service
