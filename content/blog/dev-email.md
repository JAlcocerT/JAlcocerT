**TL;DR**

SMTP stuff is messy, a collection of thoughts that helped me understand tech email concepts better

**Intro**

So far I got proper *and high level* custom email integration via:

1. ProtonMail
2. Mailerlite: they allow one custom domain free
3. Via LogTo: also to redirect to your custom domain for auth login etc

But for something more custom...I have been lacking how actually email/SMTP work.

**Introduction**

KnockMail is a tool designed to verify the existence of email addresses.

It addresses the problem of email validation, helping users confirm whether an email address is active or not. 

This can be essential for businesses and developers to maintain clean email lists and improve communication efficiency.

**Key Features**

- **Creator**: Developed by Alisson Moretto (4w4k3).
  
- **Installation and Running**:
  - Clone the repository:  
    `git clone https://github.com/4w4k3/KnockMail.git`
  - Navigate to the directory:  
    `cd KnockMail`
  - Install required packages:  
    `pip install -r requeriments.txt`
  - Run the application:  
    `python knock.py` (or `python2.7 knock.py` for Python 2.7).

- **Compatibility**: 
  - Tested on various Linux distributions: 
    - Kali Linux (SANA & ROLLING)
    - Ubuntu 14.04-16.04 LTS
    - Debian 8.5
    - Linux Mint 18.1

**Conclusion**

KnockMail is a useful tool for email verification, enhancing communication reliability. 

Similar projects include Hunter.io and NeverBounce, which offer email validation services.

**Sendgrid** just block me few minutes after creating my account.

That was interesting.
