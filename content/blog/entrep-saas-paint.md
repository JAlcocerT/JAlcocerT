**Tl;DR**

Its more and more difficult to find people to do home/paint/manual jobs.

Does this mean that capturing leads for such offers can be profitable and help people get their home ready?

**Intro**

The kind of idea that happens when you try new things and [document the process](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/buying-house-data-analytics/#estimating-painting-costs-with-ai):

* 3h / (person x m2) when indoors and all layers
* At 10$/l - Painting cost ~ 1.5$/m2 counting 2/3 layers
* Labour cost from 15$/h or 0 if you DIY :)
