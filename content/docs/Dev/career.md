There are many **unknown unknowns** in a career.

As someone said, we can just trace the dots backwards.

For the ones that would like to share their experience, creating and publishing an ebook is quite simple.

### Organizational Tools

You might need to do proper [note taking for your KB](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/knowledge-management/).

Stay in touch and [communicate](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/communication-management/) with your colleagues.

For [PMs](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/selfhosting-pm-tools-docker/) in need of a who does what, there are several tools for them.

> And Im not just talking about [Jira/ADO](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/jira-data-model-with-ai/).

Remember that ppts can be done via code, like [so](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/slidev-editor/tree/logtojseauth/slidev). With [live data capabilities](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/things-as-a-code/#slidev-and-tech-talks) via API queries.

And also those pdf reports or the

### CV Tools

I have been using a lot of **resume templates.**

From word, to pptx and later I explored canva, which resulting pdf had some [parsing issues](https://fossengineer.com/open-source-curriculum/#checking-how-readable-is-a-cv-template) for some organizations.

Then, I switched gears to **cv as a code approach**: with [OSS CV builders](https://fossengineer.com/open-source-curriculum/) and with [Latex via overleaf](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/when-to-apply-for-a-job/#cv-as-a-code)

1. YAMLResume

2. Reactive Resume
3. Open Resume, which I forked [here](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/open-resume) with a [CI/CD powered](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/dev-ops-for-non-devops/#cicd-tools) Container

4. Cool Latex CV Templates for [Overleaf](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/when-to-apply-for-a-job/#creating-a-responsive-cv)

And as some point I saw clear the setup: scrap offer + customize the cv code with LLMs as per your experience context, *aka [historieta](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/when-to-apply-for-a-job/#historieta)*:
