**1. Machine Learning/Data Science Tasks**

* **ML Algorithm Selection:**
    * **Example:** You're tasked with building a model to predict customer churn. You'd need to evaluate and compare different algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and potentially a simple Neural Network to determine which model performs best on your data.
    * **Python Implementation:**
        * Use Scikit-learn to implement and train different models.
        * Utilize functions like `train_test_split` for data splitting and `cross_val_score` for model evaluation.
        * Compare performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC.

* **Feature Engineering:**
    * **Example:** You have a dataset with raw categorical features like "country" and "city". You need to engineer new features to improve model performance. 
    * **Python Implementation:**
        * Use Pandas for data manipulation:
            * One-hot encoding for categorical variables (`pd.get_dummies()`)
            * Creating interaction features (e.g., combining "country" and "city" into a single feature)
            * Handling missing values (imputation techniques)
            * Scaling numerical features (e.g., standardization, normalization)

* **Model Training:**
    * **Example:** Train a deep learning model for image classification using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
    * **Python Implementation:**
        * Define the model architecture (layers, activation functions).
        * Implement the training loop (forward pass, backward pass, optimization).
        * Use tools like TensorBoard for visualizing training progress.

* **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
    * **Example:** Find the optimal hyperparameters for a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.
    * **Python Implementation:**
        * Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV from Scikit-learn to systematically explore different hyperparameter combinations.
        * Evaluate the performance of each combination using cross-validation.

* **Distributed Model Training:**
    * **Example:** Train a large-scale deep learning model on multiple GPUs or across a cluster of machines.
    * **Python Implementation:**
        * Utilize frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch with distributed training capabilities (e.g., using `tf.distribute` in TensorFlow).

* **Supervised and Unsupervised Learning:**
    * **Examples:**
        * Supervised: Build a spam classifier (classification), predict house prices (regression).
        * Unsupervised: Perform customer segmentation (clustering), reduce the dimensionality of your data (PCA).
    * **Python Implementation:**
        * Use Scikit-learn for a wide range of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms.

* **Building Model Pipelines:**
    * **Example:** Create a pipeline for preprocessing data, training a model, and evaluating its performance.
    * **Python Implementation:**
        * Use the `Pipeline` class in Scikit-learn to chain together different steps in your workflow.

**2. Advanced Python Skills**

* **Native Python:**
    * **Data Structures:** Working with lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples.
    * **Control Flow:** Using loops (for, while), conditional statements (if, elif, else), and functions.
    * **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Understanding classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.

* **Pandas:**
    * **Data Manipulation:** Filtering, sorting, grouping, merging, and joining DataFrames.
    * **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data types.
    * **Data Analysis:** Descriptive statistics, aggregations, and data visualization.

* **Scikit-learn:**
    * **Model Selection:** Using various classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction algorithms.
    * **Model Evaluation:** Calculating and interpreting performance metrics.
    * **Model Tuning:** Implementing techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

* **TensorFlow/PyTorch:**
    * **Building Neural Networks:** Defining and training deep learning models.
    * **Tensor Manipulation:** Working with tensors, gradients, and computational graphs.
    * **Deployment:** Preparing models for deployment in production environments.

* **PyStats:**
    * **Statistical Analysis:** Performing statistical tests, hypothesis testing, and statistical inference.
    * **Data Visualization:** Creating informative and visually appealing plots.
