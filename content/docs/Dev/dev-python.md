{{< details title="Why I love Streamlit for Quick UI's ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

Streamlit uses a combination of front-end technologies to create its user interface, primarily leveraging React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- **React.js**: Used for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- **WebSockets**: Maintains a real-time connection between the client and server for instant updates.
- **Tornado**: A Python framework that handles long-lived connections and supports the server's real-time operations.
- **Custom Components**: Allows integration of additional web technologies like JavaScript, enhancing functionality.
- **Bootstrap**: Provides styling and theming capabilities to customize the appearance of applications (CSS Framework).
- **Widgets and Markdown**: Supports a variety of interactive widgets and Markdown for easy UI development.

This setup enables you to **quickly create interactive web apps using Python**, without needing extensive frontend development skills.
