You can create **cool static websites** with these SSG frameworks.

And also with [Remix](https://github.com/jacob-ebey/remix-ssg).

Which **frameworks**? 

* https://bestofjs.org/rankings/monthly/2025/1

I mean, with: HUGO, Astro, NodeJS, jekyll...

{{< cards cols="2" >}}
  {{< card link="https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/using-astro-as-website/" title="Astro 101" >}}
  {{< card link="https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/using-hugo-as-website/" title="HUGO 101" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

And if you are new to Websites, do it (The Web [Deployment](#select-the-deployment-method)) with [Github Pages](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/how-to-use-github-pages/) to get a free subdomain with it.

If you come from a Data Analytics domain and this sounds too far out of reach. You are wrong.

I discovered static sites thanks to using first [Flexdashboards in R language](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/guide-r-flexdashboards-in-github-pages/).

These dashboards are consolidated into **"just" html information**, like static sites.

And you bet, they are **cool and functional**.

## Features for Webs

**Features** that *most likely*, you will want on your Website:

0. **Pre-Requisites**: Fast and Secure (SSL, https)
1. Search: Pagefind, FuseJS,...
2. Scheduled Posts
3. Internationalization (i18n)
4. A CDN?
5. APIs: [Forms, Newsletters](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/blog/dev-forms/), email marketing...

* For HUGO, [HUGO Theme Gallery](https://github.com/nicokaiser/hugo-theme-gallery) has OG done right

* [Firebase](https://fossengineer.com/hosting-with-firebase/)
* [Github Pages](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/how-to-use-github-pages/) or Gitlab Pages
* Cloudflare: [CLI](https://fossengineer.com/hosting-with-cloudflare-pages/) or [CF connected to a GH Repo](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/astro-web-cloudflare-pages/#cloudflare-pages-vs-other-free-deployment-methods)

{{< details title="Free SSG Deployment - Firebase CLI, Cloudflare Wrangler CLI...üìå" closed="true" >}}

1. With **Firebase**, the Free Tier allows for up to 10GB for ppl to download your content.

> Per month, and at least at the time of writing. This might (or not) change.

```sh
#npm install -g firebase-tools
#firebase login

firebase init #configure files for firebase hosting / public directory is normall public for HUGO and dist for Astro/nodes
firebase deploy #you will get something like -> https://jalcocertech.web.app/
```

2. You can also try with [Cloudflare **Workers and Pages**](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/astro-web-cloudflare-pages/#faq) or [Github Pages](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/how-to-use-github-pages/).

### Get Better at Webs

1. An overview of JS and CSS is always good!

  {{< card link="https://roadmap.sh/backend" title="Back End RoadMap" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Some [**CSS**](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/blog/dev-css/) will do the Trick. As well as [**JS** libraries](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/javascript-for-static-websites) like: PhotoSwipe,...

{{< dropdown title="Notify Google/Bing about your Website Changes based on the sitemap üìå" closed="true" >}}

There are some **Interesting Search Engines** available:

* Ecosia.org / qwant.com / Brave / DuckDuckGo / ...
* [Whoogle/SearXNG](https://jalcocert.github.io/RPi/posts/selfh-internet-better/)
* Bing 

And for you to get traffic, you need SE to be aware of your awsomeness:

1. To ping **Google's engine** to review your site's sitemap:

```sh
curl "https://www.google.com/ping?sitemap=https://www.example.com/sitemap.xml"
```

2. Don't forget about **Bing Search** as well:

```sh
curl "https://www.bing.com/ping?sitemap=https://www.example.com/sitemap.xml"
``` 

It's worth to **try few of them**.

Not all the content is indexed in the same way across engines and you can miss valuable info.
