You might be a selfhoster looking for the perfect [DB for your homelab](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/databases-101/).

A dev looking for that perfect framework and database to [bootstrap](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/whats-boostrap/) that idea.

Or *,just'* in a D&A career.

Before the tools, make sure to understand what are (and the use cases) of OLAP (D&A) vs OLTP (Dev).

The structured vs object/JSON differenciation is also important...
