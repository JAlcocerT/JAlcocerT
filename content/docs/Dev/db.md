You might be a selfhoster looking for the perfect [DB for your homelab](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/databases-101/).

A dev looking for that perfect framework and database to [bootstrap](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/whats-boostrap/) that idea.

Or *,just'* databases for a D&A career.


## Tools for DBs

Whatever your goal is, these are some Databases you can use: https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/databases-101/

Even Before that and looking to the tools, make sure to understand what are (and the use cases) of **OLAP (D&A) vs OLTP (Dev)**.

The structured vs object/JSON differenciation is also important...

> Agpl3.0 |  Database diagrams editor that allows you to visualize and design your DB with a single query. 


## OLAP and Databases

I will focus this section on the D&A goal of databases, which is to **READ and analyze** huge amounts of data.

### Data Stories with a Notebook and ipyvizzu

If you feel confortable with Jupyter notebooks, have a look to: https://github.com/vizzuhq/ipyvizzu-story

This is food for thought if you normally create presentations with SliDev for [tech talks](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/ai-driven-diagrams/#mermaid-x-tech-talk)!
