You can create cool static websites with these frameworks, and also with [Remix](https://github.com/jacob-ebey/remix-ssg).

I mean, with HUGO, Astro, NodeJS, jekyll...

And if you are new to Websites, do it (The Web [Deployment](#select-the-deployment-method)) with [Github Pages](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/how-to-use-github-pages/) to get a free subdomain with it.

{{< details title="Important Files for all Webs ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}


Look always for the `<head>` - It will guide you to a `Base.astro`, `BaseLayout.astro`, `head.html`...

In there you can do interesting things, like adding web analytics.

You will **need astrojs/mdx installed** first and use it within .mdx files:

```astro
import { Image } from 'astro:assets'

import photopost1b from '../../assets/image.jpg';

<figure>
  <Image src={photopost1b} width={500} height={200} alt="Exploring Astro Images" />
  <figcaption class="caption">Say hi to Astro</figcaption>
</figure>
```

## Tweaking HUGO Themes

[HUGO](https://fossengineer.com/web-guide-Hugo/) is great.

The [HUGO **Setup**](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/using-hugo-as-website/) was the first SSG that I could get working back in the days.


{{< details title="HUGO Themes I LikeðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

* You can combine HUGO with RevealJS to create [awsome presentations](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/ai-useful-yet-simple/#slides-creation-agent)!
  * Similarly to what we can do with [**SliDev** - Example at MultiChat](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/create-streamlit-chatgpt/#a-multichat-with-streamlit)
  * HUGO + RevealJS - [Sample1](https://github.com/joshed-io/reveal-hugo), [Sample2](https://github.com/RealOrangeOne/hugo-theme-revealjs)

{{< details title="How to add `ads.txt` to HUGO ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

1. **Create an `ads.txt` file** in your Hugo projectâ€™s `static` directory. The `static` folder in Hugo is where you put any files you want to be copied directly to the root of your build output.

2. **Add your content** to the `ads.txt` file:

```plaintext
   google.com, pub-123456, DIRECT, abcdef123456
```

3. **Build your Hugo site**:

4. **Verify the output** by checking the `public` directory (Hugo's default output folder). You should find the `ads.txt` file in the root of `public`:


5. **Deploy your site** as usual. The `ads.txt` file should now be available at `https://yourdomain.com/ads.txt`. 

This method ensures that `ads.txt` is part of your siteâ€™s root directory in the final build output, as required by ad networks.

### HUGO with Github Pages & CICD

Its very important to know the **HUGO Version** that makes the theme work.

Laos when you are using [Github Actions Workflow](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/JAlcocerT/blob/main/.github/workflows/pages.yaml).

{{< callout type="info" >}}
The workflow configures [the base path to work properly](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/JAlcocerT/blob/main/.github/workflows/pages.yaml#L57) as per your repo name
{{< /callout >}}

This Hextra Theme, as it is, for example, [runs fine with v0.117.0](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.117.0):

```sh
hugo v0.117.0-b2f0696cad918fb61420a6aff173eb36662b406e+extended linux/amd64 BuildDate=2023-08-07T12:49:48Z VendorInfo=gohugoio
```

But **not with higher versions like v0.124**.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
[Setup HUGO ](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/using-hugo-as-website/)properly!
{{< /callout >}}

### Interesting Search Engines

* Ecosia.org / qwant.com / Brave / DuckDuckGo
* [Whoogle/SearXNG](https://jalcocert.github.io/RPi/posts/selfh-internet-better/)

It's worth to try few of them - not all the content is indexed in the same way across engines
