You can create cool static websites with these frameworks, and also with [Remix](https://github.com/jacob-ebey/remix-ssg)

{{< details title="Important Files for all Webs ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}


Look always for the `<head>` - It will guide you to a `Base.astro`, `BaseLayout.astro`, `head.html`...

In there you can do interesting things, like adding web analytics.

{{< details title="How to add ads.txt to HUGO ðŸ“Œ" closed="true" >}}

1. **Create an `ads.txt` file** in your Hugo projectâ€™s `static` directory. The `static` folder in Hugo is where you put any files you want to be copied directly to the root of your build output.

2. **Add your content** to the `ads.txt` file:

```plaintext
   google.com, pub-123456, DIRECT, abcdef123456
```

3. **Build your Hugo site**:

4. **Verify the output** by checking the `public` directory (Hugo's default output folder). You should find the `ads.txt` file in the root of `public`:


5. **Deploy your site** as usual. The `ads.txt` file should now be available at `https://yourdomain.com/ads.txt`. 

This method ensures that `ads.txt` is part of your siteâ€™s root directory in the final build output, as required by ad networks.

### Interesting Search Engines

* Ecosia.org / qwant.com / Brave / DuckDuckGo
* [Whoogle/SearXNG](https://jalcocert.github.io/RPi/posts/selfh-internet-better/)
* Bing 

It's worth to try few of them - not all the content is indexed in the same way across engines
