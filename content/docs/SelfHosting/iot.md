I got started with IoT thanks to a [Pi SBC](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/cloud-vs-single-board-computers/) and made some public projects, which I documented [also publically, here](https://jalcocert.github.io/RPi/).

After many many hours of tinkering and learning IoT, I've come to the conclusion that it's a great way to learn about hardware and software.
