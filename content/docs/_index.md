Welcome to the Docs!

The day by day journey from the [blog section](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/blog/) might not be from everyone.

So created these docs as a curated higher level version of the technologies Ive used.

For some posts, ill assume that you are not scared about Linux:

```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt install flatpak gnome-software-plugin-flatpak -y
sudo apt install gnome-software -y
```

Neither the terminal, aka CLI:

```sh
flatpak install flathub app.zen_browser.zen -y
```

In [Windows](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/how-to-use-chocolatey-windows/) you can also use it, like:

```sh
choco install zen
```

But in general this section is beginner friendly and aimed to give you a range of options/tools to consider for your own jouney.

From your [tech career](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/docs/dev/) to your [entrepreneurial journey](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/docs/entrepreneur/), going in between for the geek one with [HomeLabs and IoT](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/docs/selfhosting/).
