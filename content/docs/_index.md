Welcome to the Docs!

Here you have an overview of what you can learn.

For some posts, ill assume that you are not scared about Linux nor the terminal:

```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt install flatpak gnome-software-plugin-flatpak -y
sudo apt install gnome-software -y
```

Neither the terminal

```sh
flatpak install flathub app.zen_browser.zen -y
```

In Windows you can also use it, like:

```sh
choco install zen
```
