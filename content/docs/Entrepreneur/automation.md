If you are doing a lot of volume of work and want to scale, you can **automate**.

Everything that can be automated, can be scaled.

> But not everything is worth automating - Be [lean](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/lean/)!

Wheter it makes sense or not it depends on your offer and who are you selling to.

If you are scoping B2C, be prepared for a huge amount of automation/resources to make that the value flows properly to (and from) your clients.

That does not mean that you cant setup high value proposition (like bots) for your B2C.

But...email automation is more about ESP, like mailtrap, Resend, Mailjet or Amazon SES.

Ive enjoyed sending mails via Mailtrap as done with [this DIY Landing Boilerplate](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/diy-landing-boilerplate/#sending-via-mailtrap)
