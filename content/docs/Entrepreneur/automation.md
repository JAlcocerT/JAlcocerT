If you are doing a lot of volume of work and want to scale, you can **automate**.

Everything that can be automated, can be scaled.

> But not everything is worth automating - Be [lean](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/lean/)!

Wheter it makes sense or not it depends on your offer and who are you selling to.

If you are scoping B2C, be prepared for a huge amount of automation/resources to make that the value flows properly to your clients.

That does not mean that you cant setup high value proposition (like bots) for your B2C.
