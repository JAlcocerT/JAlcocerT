[Boostrapping](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/whats-boostrap/) is not straight forward.

It's a journey of doing more, better, newer - all of the time surounded with unknowns.

```

For anyone who has [cycled](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/buying-bicycle-through-data-analytics/) 100km+, you know that half of the way are the last 10km of [the journey](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/tech-for-a-trip/).

But these are some tools that make getting returns from [what you build](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/docs/entrepreneur/bip/) more likely:

1. [Automation](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/docs/entrepreneur/automation/):
2. [Bots](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/docs/entrepreneur/bots/):
3. [Marketing](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/docs/entrepreneur/marketing/):

Formbricks wont validate the emails, but you can even [verify emails](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/docs/dev/authentication/#email-verification) before they flow into your sales pipelines.

### PostHog

Posthog is [one of the product tools](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/product-tools/) you can use surveys.

Also to bring [session recording](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/how-to-record-web-sessions/) for your apps.

## Offers

With a clear product defined, the package of that into an **compeling offer** is key.

Info is...free. Implementation is not:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Time vs Money] --> B(blog/YT 0$);
    A --> C(DIY 0/$);
    A --> D(Consult via Cal.com - DWY $$);
    A --> E(Services - DFY $$$);
```

It's all about how valuable your clients perceive their time is compared to how good your offer is to solve their problems.

You can frame this in a trol yet simple CSR bar to help them decide:




> Mind the increased Chances of people who never helped others for free calling you evil :)
